1
-00:03:07,500 --> -00:03:05,700
In previous episodes...

2
-00:03:05,652 --> -00:03:03,627
I'm Julia Wilson, a scientist.

3
-00:03:03,626 --> -00:03:00,959
Ricardo Montero, the captain.

4
-00:03:00,958 --> -00:02:59,239
Here is the training ship Stella Polare,

5
-00:02:59,238 --> -00:02:56,153
There's a storm coming our way, can you hear me?

6
-00:02:53,357 --> -00:02:49,242
In fact, an accident during the start-up of the particle accelerator,

7
-00:02:49,241 --> -00:02:46,269
may have caused consequences of immeasurable proportions.

8
-00:02:43,103 --> -00:02:39,374
The most likely hypothesis is that a black hole was created.

9
-00:02:39,373 --> -00:02:37,301
According to the most optimistic estimates,

10
-00:02:37,268 --> -00:02:33,443
would have absorbed 500 cubic km of geological mass.

11
-00:02:33,442 --> -00:02:31,145
The storm was not a climatic event,

12
-00:02:31,144 --> -00:02:29,972
It was a catastrophe.

13
-00:02:29,971 --> -00:02:28,413
What would that mean?

14
-00:02:28,412 --> -00:02:24,989
It is very likely that we are the only inhabitants of the world.

15
-00:02:24,988 --> -00:02:22,418
Captain, on behalf of the crew and passengers,

16
-00:02:22,417 --> -00:02:21,212
I order you to take us to port.

17
-00:02:21,211 --> -00:02:17,789
The Earth, as we knew it,

18
-00:02:17,788 --> -00:02:16,246
it no longer exists.

19
-00:02:13,385 --> -00:02:10,412
You take care of the body. I'll disappear on a ship for as long as necessary.

20
-00:02:10,411 --> -00:02:09,174
Leave him.

21
-00:02:08,306 --> -00:02:06,410
I do not tolerate mutinies on my ship.

22
-00:02:06,409 --> -00:02:04,336
I'm sorry, Captain, this ship is no longer yours.

23
-00:02:04,256 --> -00:02:03,067
"7-7-9-1"

24
-00:02:03,066 --> -00:02:01,620
"New York non c'�."

25
-00:02:01,619 --> -00:02:00,334
"There is no JFK. There is no JFK."

26
-00:02:00,333 --> -00:01:59,113
"We're losing altitude."

27
-00:01:59,081 --> -00:01:57,361
"Two planes just crashed before our eyes."

28
-00:01:57,136 --> -00:01:55,947
The device,

29
-00:01:55,946 --> -00:01:53,841
It's a kind of transmitter,

30
-00:01:53,359 --> -00:01:50,562
It is used to send a signal indicating our position.

31
-00:01:50,385 --> -00:01:48,859
Is it sending a signal?

32
-00:01:48,858 --> -00:01:47,026
- To whom? - I don't know.

33
-00:01:47,025 --> -00:01:45,001
- You'll be glued to Julia all night. - Okay.

34
-00:01:45,000 --> -00:01:43,346
Wouldn't you like to know...

35
-00:01:43,345 --> -00:01:41,401
Who would you like to kiss?

36
-00:01:40,983 --> -00:01:38,315
- Why are you locked up? - Family problems.

37
-00:01:38,106 --> -00:01:36,194
I always take pictures of the beautiful things I see.

38
-00:01:35,599 --> -00:01:32,384
Would the captain's daughter accept a date with the ship's villain?

39
-00:01:32,383 --> -00:01:29,749
Are you going to a reception with the ambassador?

40
-00:01:29,748 --> -00:01:28,748
More or less.

41
-00:01:27,868 --> -00:01:26,727
I have an appointment.

42
-00:01:24,525 --> -00:01:23,014
You should be more careful.

43
-00:01:23,013 --> -00:01:21,102
And are you sure you're making the right choice?

44
-00:01:21,101 --> -00:01:19,302
Because I think you're wrong.

45
-00:01:15,621 --> -00:01:13,355
I don't want a girlfriend. I don't want one.

46
-00:01:13,354 --> -00:01:11,973
Did you do something to your hair?

47
-00:01:11,972 --> -00:01:10,205
They're the same, I didn't do anything.

48
-00:01:10,204 --> -00:01:08,388
Well, better.

49
-00:01:08,387 --> -00:01:06,974
They look good on you like this.

50
-00:01:05,688 --> -00:01:03,470
I think I'm in love with Salome.

51
-00:01:03,358 --> -00:01:00,834
And what if suddenly there was someone...

52
-00:01:00,833 --> -00:00:59,597
interested in you...

53
-00:00:59,596 --> -00:00:55,659
that right now he didn't care about all your flaws?

54
-00:00:54,727 --> -00:00:53,055
We should talk about this, shouldn't we?

55
-00:00:47,655 --> -00:00:45,775
The crossing was supposed to last two months.

56
-00:00:45,774 --> -00:00:42,673
We'll stay afloat until we die like rats in a trap, damn it.

57
-00:00:40,471 --> -00:00:38,783
Gentlemen!

58
-00:00:37,578 --> -00:00:35,408
It seems to me you're forgetting something.

59
-00:00:35,151 --> -00:00:33,737
We are alive.

60
-00:00:32,515 --> -00:00:28,577
I'm convinced that there are other people alive out there.

61
-00:00:28,384 --> -00:00:25,781
So what we have to do is get organized.

62
-00:00:25,780 --> -00:00:23,193
From now on, your cabins will be your homes,

63
-00:00:23,192 --> -00:00:21,200
your companions, your family.

64
-00:00:21,199 --> -00:00:18,098
Because the 75 meters of this ship,

65
-00:00:18,097 --> -00:00:15,944
I am the only solid thing you will step on.

66
-00:00:15,943 --> -00:00:12,457
Until we find this new land, the doctor talks about.

67
-00:00:10,898 --> -00:00:08,069
Excellent performance.

68
-00:00:07,812 --> -00:00:06,189
I don't believe in anything.

69
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,210
Ricardo, come.

70
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,100
Captain, something's happening.

71
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,220
We're going more than ten knots with the engines off and it's not the wind pushing us.

72
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,660
I know. It's a current that's dragging us along.

73
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,780
Lower all sails.

74
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,060
And what kind of current drags a 500-ton ship in the middle of the ocean?

75
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,360
I have no idea.

76
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,260
It'll be another consequence of the particle cataclysm, damn it.

77
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,110
The fact is that we are going at full speed.

78
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,040
The cataclysm, right?

79
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,650
Any ideas, son?

80
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,180
The wind has nothing to do with it here.

81
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,490
Stay the course. I'm going to talk to the doctor.

82
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
All right.

83
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,050
We have to stop the ship.

84
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,570
If something appears up there, we won't have time to maneuver, you know.

85
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:27,150
There's nothing out there to crash into,

86
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,770
Do I need to remind you?

87
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,850
So be quiet and obey the captain's orders.

88
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,900
On your marks. Bear down and burn, come on.

89
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,900
My father says that in life,

90
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:44,490
There is always someone who commands and someone who obeys.

91
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,270
My mother was in charge of me, and when she went to heaven,

92
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,090
Miss Maica was in charge.

93
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:58,090
And now that he's not there, Ahinoa is in charge.

94
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:00,620
Land in sight, Captain. Do you see it?

95
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,760
- Yes, I see it. - What do we do?

96
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,270
But I also have authority over someone.

97
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,500
Embolo, batten down the hatches and wind at your back.

98
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,360
Yes, Captain. Hatches closed.

99
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:13,480
Lower the jib.

100
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,960
And full speed ahead.

101
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,110
- Set the mainsail. - Ready to board!

102
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,240
Yes, Captain.

103
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:28,300
Even though dad says there's always someone who's bossing around,

104
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,210
I know there are people who don't like taking orders.

105
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,720
Damn, a cookie.

106
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,240
Are we celebrating something, Salome? Is there a party?

107
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:41,480
I'm sorry, darling, it's not easy for me, or for you, or for anyone.

108
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,080
We're not celebrating anything, Piti. We're just plain hungry.

109
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,590
I'm getting pissed off, we've been eating bread and water for two days.

110
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:54,960
- And two minutes each for the shower. - I ask you for a little patience.

111
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,715
There's nothing we can do about it.

112
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:59,019
We don't know how much longer we'll have to stay at sea.

113
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,090
- What do you want? - People get angry when they're hungry.

114
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,670
- Do you see anyone happy? - Please.

115
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,840
'Fuck the captain's rationing.

116
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,050
I've been up since 4 this morning.

117
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,140
Sailor, let this be the last time you make a scene like that in my mess hall.

118
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,620
Doctor.

119
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,390
- Doctor, I need to talk to you. - I'm taking a shower, Captain.

120
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:28,600
- I'll be out in a moment. - There's no time.

121
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,630
I need to know why the ocean that covers half the planet is dragging us along.

122
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,430
What?

123
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,110
We lowered the sails.

124
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,637
- That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. - Give it here.

125
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,400
I don't know what the hell is out there.

126
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,650
See something? Leave it and go outside.

127
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,450
Shit.

128
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,940
At that time?

129
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,930
Reel!

130
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,200
We're heading straight for a whirlpool. Dad!

131
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,730
Dai, dai!

132
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,085
Whirlpool! It's a whirlpool, and we're falling into it.

133
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:20,307
Turn to starboard.

134
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,720
Steer as hard to port as you can or she'll swallow us up!

135
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,590
Shut up and let me do my job.

136
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,490
Engines full reverse. This is an emergency maneuver.

137
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,770
Engines full reverse.

138
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,090
- At this speed we'll break in two. - Shut up.

139
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,460
- Full speed ahead. - Shut up.

140
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,690
We have to get out of the whirlpool.

141
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,180
Gentlemen, full speed ahead.

142
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,380
- What the hell are you doing? - Listen.

143
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,240
- What's up? - Dad, listen to me for a moment.

144
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,890
For once in your life,

145
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
listen to me, please.

146
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
Full speed ahead.

147
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,950
- Countermand, full speed ahead. - What?

148
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,920
You heard, countermand, full speed ahead, go ahead!

149
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,830
Damn, I can't do it.

150
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,860
The oceans are healing.

151
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,340
Imagine millions of cubic tons of water jostling for space.

152
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,720
I resisted.

153
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,300
At this rate we'll break the rudder blade.

154
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,950
Come on, beautiful, hold on, hold on.

155
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,379
The temperature of the planet that regulates the currents has changed.

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,220
And this is just the beginning.

157
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,610
Force.

158
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,400
Force.

159
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,580
- Ulises... - Hang in there, we'll get past him.

160
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,600
Resist, resist.

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,270
We got over it.

162
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,760
We got over it, Dad.

163
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
You sure are stubborn. I...

164
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,869
I'll break your...

165
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,640
- It's true that you are my son. - I told you.

166
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
I told you.

167
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,756
- Is everything okay? - Yes.

168
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,233
I'm sorry, excuse me.

169
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,558
Is everyone okay?

170
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,480
- Is he okay? - Yes.

175
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,020
At that time?

176
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,250
I checked this entire area and the hull shows no damage.

177
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:45,050
But the keel is stuck in a huge rock, from here to here.

178
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,030
The ship is in the balance.

179
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:52,660
Wait.

180
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,670
My God. She's listing to starboard.

181
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:03,262
A wave to port would capsize the ship and we would sink.

182
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,610
- Manuel, start the engines. - No. Absolutely not.

183
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,560
If we push the ship while we are stuck in the rock,

184
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,159
- He'll cut himself like a can. - And you propose to stay here?

185
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:17,293
A treacherous sea wave would split us in two like a walnut.

186
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,410
Any other metaphors?

187
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,380
Manuel, start the engines.

188
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:28,300
- 1400 rpm. - He's making a mistake.

189
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,130
1500. More, Manuel, it increases.

190
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,880
1600 rpm, increase, Manuel.

191
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,150
ELECTIONS

192
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,290
1600! 1800!

193
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,320
Increase!

194
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,850
- I'll split the ship in two, Captain. - Ulises!

195
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,690
I'll split the ship in two, Captain.

196
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,530
Agree.

197
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,290
I want cargo and crew as counterweight on the port side or we'll capsize.

198
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,860
We will wait for the tide.

199
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,070
If there are still tides at all.

200
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,050
Enough, please, enough!

201
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,350
What the hell is going on?

202
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:35,740
Enough, please, enough!

203
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,470
Silence!

204
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,180
Doctor, we have a problem.

205
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,950
Silence, I said!

206
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:50,780
- I can't now, Embolo. - No, please, it's Valeria, she's in the infirmary.

207
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,490
Let's go.

208
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,010
We want to know what's going on, Captain.

209
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,660
We ran aground.

210
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,740
We have to wait 12 hours for the tide to bring us back up to the surface.

211
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,420
Non cos, De la Cuadra?

212
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,780
Yes, indeed.

213
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,870
It looks like a clear fracture,

214
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,693
but I don't think I can save him.

215
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,370
I will have to have a transplant.

216
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,470
- It was my fault. - Will it hurt him?

217
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:30,490
No, darling. He's a brave little bear.

218
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,830
And then, I anesthetized him,

219
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,570
and no, it won't hurt him, you'll see.

220
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,480
Give me a needle and some fabric.

221
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,420
Fico doesn't like stings,

222
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,790
but if you sing he doesn't cry.

223
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Ah, what?

224
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,800
We see.

225
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:00,572
Don't look, Valeria.

226
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,550
<i>(DRUME NEGRITA, Cuban song)</i> <i>To the little black girl</i>

227
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,120
<i>the feet come out</i>

228
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,650
<i>from the crib.</i>

229
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,710
<i>And he doesn't know what to do.</i>

230
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:20,743
<i>If he doesn't sleep, I'll send him the shaman with the scythe.</i>

231
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,920
<i>But if she sleeps I'll bring her</i> <i>an apricot, sweet sweet.</i>

232
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,840
All crew will move to the port cabins to provide counterweight.

233
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:34,501
Water remains limited, as does the use of electronic devices.

234
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:35,867
But how...

235
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:37,088
Captain!

236
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,900
And where are we going to take a shit?

237
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,910
Whoever needs to empty their ass, get your ass overboard.

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,970
- But to port. - Captain,

239
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:55,570
He gives us a biscuit for breakfast, now he wants to herd us like animals without water.

240
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,660
And what do those who don't want to do?

241
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,100
It's true, Captain. He doesn't take us into consideration.

242
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,850
And nobody asked us anything.

243
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,950
A ship is not a condominium.

244
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:07,047
But not even a dictatorship where they tell you when to go to the bathroom, captain.

245
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:09,440
- Exactly. - Exactly.

246
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,620
Did you decide?

247
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:14,100
- The boys are not wrong. - Some of you are capable,

248
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,530
to ration food so as not to die in two days?

249
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,540
I volunteer.

250
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,180
Captain, those who put you in command are no longer there.

251
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,620
And we didn't choose it.

252
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,700
I propose that we call elections.

253
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,860
Yes. Elections!

254
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:42,110
Elections! Elections!

255
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,960
- Silence! - Elections! Elections!

256
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,510
I just placed an order!

257
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,430
I don't want any more debates or meetings.

258
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,780
Ten o'clock, everyone's curfew. I don't want any trouble.

259
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,610
Go.

260
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Didn't you hear me? Come on, hurry up.

261
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,130
Get out of here.

262
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,540
Didn't you hear me?

263
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,130
That's it.

264
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,100
- Do you have children? - No.

265
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,030
But I wish I had a little girl like you.

266
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,550
Come on, come on.

267
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,530
Did you hear? He wants a little girl like me.

268
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,900
Girls, don't change rooms.

269
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,440
Guys, the group is breaking up. They're all moving to the port side,

270
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,499
by order of his excellency the captain.

271
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:20,994
We won't get anything this way.

272
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,015
But at least we'll have mixed dormitories.

273
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,542
- Guys. - Look on the bright side.

274
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,017
- The mattresses. - Listen, Palomares, one thing.

275
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,898
You priests... do you have erections?

276
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:33,399
You're stupid.

277
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:36,279
It was a curiosity. Palomares...

278
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:40,784
Ainhoa.

279
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:44,315
I wanted to explain to you what happened with your father...

280
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,181
- What? - Yes, sir.

281
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:55,565
He's hanging on your every word, isn't he?

282
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,494
Don't take it personally, Ulises, but...

283
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,985
If you like Ahinoa, you're in trouble.

284
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:01,625
Stop it, Piti.

285
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,241
I can do it alone, I don't need help.

286
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:05,600
Thank you.

287
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,057
Okay, okay.

288
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:11,059
You take speedboats in storms, you dive 100 meters for a black box,

289
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,460
but then, you like a girl and you let a scoundrel like Gamboa take her.

290
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,835
You just have to get used to it.

291
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,435
Wait.

292
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,621
Did you ask Ainhoa ​​if she likes you?

293
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,889
Listen, I'll give you some advice.

294
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,555
Ed � free.

295
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,646
You be careful...

296
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,871
if he turns to look at you as you walk away after you've talked.

297
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:40,329
Because if she does... it means she likes you.

298
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,580
Ed cos Ulysses, cos

299
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,132
Notice that detail, notice it.

300
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,474
And what the hell do you have against my father?

301
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:08,405
You question him, you turn everyone against him, and on top of that you call for elections to replace him.

302
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:11,620
Do you think he'll listen to me if I send him a written complaint?

303
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:14,384
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

304
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,592
You want his place.

305
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:19,286
What, you think you're a better captain than him?

306
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,459
No.

307
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,160
But he became a tyrant.

308
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,620
Curfews, rationing, cuts.

309
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,623
He gives no explanations, he takes no one into consideration.

310
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,571
My father is not a dictator, so stop doing that.

311
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:32,984
I know.

312
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:36,073
What I'm doing is for his own good.

313
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,903
In the corridors there is already talk of getting rid of him.

314
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,350
To see him dead.

315
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:46,763
- Who? Who? - Nobody. Nobody.

316
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:48,942
Everyone, no one, gossip.

317
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,395
If your father doesn't loosen the rope...

318
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,095
they will use it to hang him.

319
00:16:57,088 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm simply giving him a chance to legitimize himself.

320
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,478
Believe me.

321
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,255
Believe me.

322
00:17:27,684 --> 00:17:30,246
If only the solution were as easy as...

323
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,649
put a wish in a bottle and throw it into the sea.

324
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,859
- Stop, stop. - No. No.

325
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,386
No, please.

326
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:28,167
Please, please.

327
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,280
Get out of here immediately.

328
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm not going out. You go out and close the door, please.

329
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:54,870
Come on, go back to your cabin. Let's go.

330
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,277
Come on, I won't tell you again.

331
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,690
- Get out of here. - Leave me alone.

332
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,016
Let's go.

333
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:36,529
Captain.

334
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:38,513
You have to come to the classroom, it's urgent.

335
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,034
Pap�!

336
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:43,357
Captain, come to the courtroom immediately. It's urgent.

337
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,207
- That's a problem. - Dad!

338
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,656
I'm here darling, what's going on?

339
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,545
I can't open the door.

340
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:50,075
Did you lock it again?

341
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:51,689
- No. - What the hell is going on?

342
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,932
Help me, she's stuck.

343
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,221
Valeria, darling.

344
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:57,050
Move away from the door, now let's push hard, okay?

345
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:58,915
- Okay. - Come on.

346
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,999
One, two and three.

347
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,536
Damn!

348
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,381
Ricardo, leave it to me.

349
00:20:08,397 --> 00:20:10,291
Valeria, stay aside.

350
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,739
Valeria, darling.

351
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,809
I've told you a thousand times not to close the door when you're alone.

352
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,355
Are you OK?

353
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:25,632
Come on, it's all okay, darling. It's over.

354
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,951
So you know for next time.

355
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:29,283
Ricardo.

356
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,622
- Come. - Wait here a moment.

357
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,097
What happens?

358
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,418
Steel.

359
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:37,986
It is giving way under the pressure of the water.

360
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,962
The ship is crashing, Ricardo.

361
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:52,877
They called a strike.

362
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,316
They say they won't get up until I call elections.

363
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,662
Elections?

364
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:58,350
'Fuck democracy.

365
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:00,297
- Everybody stand up, for God's sake. - Stand up.

366
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,324
What happens?

367
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,313
What's the matter with you?

368
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,463
You want to put a brat in charge? Will he sink the ship?

369
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:08,616
Come on, everybody stand up.

370
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,686
You heard me. Come on, everybody stand up.

371
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,853
You. Stand up.

372
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:15,949
Stand up, what the fuck.

373
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:18,543
- Stand up, you piece of... - All right, all right.

374
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,189
- Don't touch us! - All right, all right.

375
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:30,175
Everybody stand up.

376
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,763
Captain.

377
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,619
Is this how things are done on the ship now, by shouting and pushing?

378
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:51,625
I'm sorry, but not like that.

379
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:55,470
- What are you doing? - Don't touch me.

380
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,727
Ricardo.

381
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:13,054
Maybe they're right.

382
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:14,919
Nobody talks about commanding the ship,

383
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,384
but only of civil life, everyday things.

384
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,520
And for this, the majority's approval is needed.

385
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,664
Tomorrow between 8:00 and 12:00 in the morning,

386
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:37,386
Voting will take place to elect a...

387
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:41,645
mayor.

388
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:48,175
Until then, the orders remain the same.

389
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:16,532
What did I tell you?

390
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:19,024
What if he turned to look at you...

391
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,395
Do you need help or not?

392
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:24,828
Come on, come on.

393
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:04,063
Julia and Salome have already taken possession of my cabin.

394
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:08,274
You know what Salome says? That she doesn't want to change the sheets.

395
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:11,130
Because he says they know about me. How do you interpret that?

396
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:14,601
He's losing his sense of smell. Hurry up. And be quiet, you'll wake the little girl.

397
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,045
Let's go to sleep.

398
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:24,130
Step aside.

399
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,503
Step aside.

400
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,495
Do you think she's in love?

401
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,693
I caught Ainhoa ​​in the cabin with Gamboa.

402
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:43,460
Naked.

403
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,082
Damn.

404
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,861
And what did you do?

405
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,216
I threw her out into the hallway, like a Taliban.

406
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,299
Dragging her by the arm.

407
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:57,324
In your underwear.

408
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:10,069
Well, damn it, what else were you supposed to do?

409
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:12,814
Excuse me.

410
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,255
Close the door and leave.

411
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:56,716
<i>If anyone finds this note, don't lose your smile.</i>

412
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,248
<i>There is still life and hope on the North Star.</i>

413
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:33,988
Let's go. Listen, Ulises.

414
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:36,624
You can tell a girl you like her a thousand times.

415
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,874
But until a friend tells him, he doesn't even see you.

416
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:40,263
- He doesn't even see you. - Wait.

417
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:41,816
Is this why I have to sleep with them?

418
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:42,980
- Right. - No.

419
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:46,579
Sneer at them a little, be nice. And smile. Always smile.

420
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:50,062
What do you do outside the cabin?

421
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:52,905
It's 10:30 PM and there's a curfew.

422
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:54,352
I have to report.

423
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:55,985
You are absolutely right.

424
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:59,725
No, you can't report me, Embolo.

425
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:02,113
Because I... am from the Canary Islands.

426
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:03,473
We are an hour behind.

427
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:05,694
So I still have about half an hour.

428
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,696
And that blanket?

429
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:16,636
I'm a little chilly.

430
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,669
Okay.

431
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:22,109
Wait. No, listen...

432
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:30,045
Do you know what a particle accelerator is?

433
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:35,445
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, when we have a moment, I'll explain it to you.

434
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:37,265
Come on, goodnight.

435
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,566
What's up?

436
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,460
I've never spoken to any of them.

437
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:43,276
- Today is the opportunity. - No, today is not...

438
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:45,076
- Yes it is. - No. Today...

439
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:49,416
Sorry, girls. Do you have a place for Ulises?

440
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,004
The poor guy was left without a cabin, and was about to go to sleep in the hold.

441
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,909
- In the hold? - Yes.

442
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:56,241
It does not matter.

443
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,773
With how cold it is.

444
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,815
That's what I say too.

445
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,121
Well, if you want, stay here.

446
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:03,881
I think Ainhoa ​​won't come.

447
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:06,332
You could have said that before, couldn't you, darling?

448
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:09,402
Excuse me.

449
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:12,094
Excuse me.

450
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:14,312
Thank you so much, everyone.

451
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:15,469
Too kind.

452
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,290
Good night, ladies.

453
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,045
It's cold, huh?

454
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,723
Well...

455
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:32,854
- Good night. - Good night.

456
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,563
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

457
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:53,665
She told me you weren't coming. Right?

458
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:58,192
Don't worry, I'm going to the hold. I'll get my things and...

459
00:28:58,193 --> 00:28:59,363
- I'm going to the hold. - No.

460
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:02,060
- Seriously. - Seriously, no.

461
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,242
Subtract with me.

462
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:10,791
All right.

463
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,577
Ricardo, did I sleep?

464
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:43,819
Sleep?

465
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:47,081
With all that has happened, I who call elections,

466
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:48,799
like Adolfo Suarez.

467
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:52,069
Are they still awake?

468
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:54,780
What if we invite them for a drink?

469
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:56,050
And then what?

470
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:57,994
A ride on the bumper cars?

471
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,911
Sleep, Julian.

472
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:03,670
I can't sleep, Ricardo.

473
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,969
I can't stop thinking about Salome.

474
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:09,052
To all the time I've wasted.

475
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,555
To what you were saying.

476
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:12,004
About love.

477
00:30:12,005 --> 00:30:13,794
And on the fact that I have...

478
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:15,753
the handbrake is on.

479
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:19,797
To hell with it.

480
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,537
What are you doing, Julian?

481
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:23,321
You'll end up waking Valeria.

482
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:25,021
Let it be.

483
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,537
What are you doing, spying on them?

484
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:30,462
Get down there. And cover yourself. Your hair's showing, damn it.

485
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:31,733
What nonsense.

486
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:33,659
A life that we travel together halfway around the world,

487
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,560
and suddenly, one day, you look at it with different eyes.

488
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:39,365
Yes, because until yesterday you were telling him all sorts of things.

489
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,991
Do you see a future for it?

490
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:43,805
Truly.

491
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:45,247
What future do you want me to see for us?

492
00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:49,371
So sour and grumpy. With his rules and discipline. No.

493
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,810
I'm not sure.

494
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,157
I'll tell you something, Julia.

495
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:57,683
A relationship, as soon as you stop improvising,

496
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:00,261
It fades like a flower. That's how it is.

497
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:01,411
But did you hear it?

498
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:02,458
I don't improvise?

499
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:05,423
The one who kept us grouper fillet and escarole says so

500
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:07,250
from Athens to Valencia, damn it.

501
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,391
Pig...

502
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:09,892
And you?

503
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:11,687
- Me? - You.

504
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:14,499
- What? - There's someone you like, right?

505
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:18,375
This is madness.

506
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,703
After Philippe,

507
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:23,029
I thought it was all over for me.

508
00:31:23,723 --> 00:31:26,736
I don't know, it all happened so fast.

509
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:31,615
Per� s�.

510
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,125
There's someone I like.

511
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:36,653
Listen.

512
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:37,918
I know who he is.

513
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,409
- Ah s�? - Diamine.

514
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,366
- Who? - The captain.

515
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,992
But no, not the captain.

516
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:48,266
- Swear it's not the captain. - I swear it's not the captain.

517
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:51,749
It's Ulises.

518
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,005
Ricardo.

519
00:31:58,206 --> 00:31:59,582
They were talking about you, Ricardo.

520
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:01,671
- She fucking likes you. - Enough.

521
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:04,327
Enough, I don't want to hear anything else.

522
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:06,862
And let's go to sleep, the little girl will wake up.

523
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,498
Ricardo, listen.

524
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:12,988
On the other side, there is the woman I have always loved.

525
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,801
Always, for life.

526
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:17,214
And I don't want to let another twenty years go by,

527
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:20,572
to find the courage to knock on his door.

528
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,841
Ricardo, come on, please. Let's go.

529
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:27,688
- Okay. - Perfect!

530
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:54,767
You're shaking.

531
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,409
Are you cold?

532
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:01,710
No, it's anger.

533
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,684
I'm twenty years old and no one has the right to humiliate me like this.

534
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,557
Least of all my father.

535
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:14,960
If I sleep with Gamboa, or with the whole crew.

536
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,566
Get over it,

537
00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:22,977
because the ship is dad's house and you will spend the rest of your life here.

538
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:26,888
I don't feel like joking.

539
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,049
For a father...

540
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:36,520
No one person is the right one for their daughter.

541
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,525
It's written on the father's license.

542
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:50,442
Well, maybe he's not the right person,

543
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:55,355
But I have the right to bang my head against the wall by myself, right?

544
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
Right.

545
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:02,665
I don't know, maybe...

546
00:34:08,284 --> 00:34:10,288
if one day you bang your head against that wall...

547
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:15,296
and you need someone to put a band-aid on you,

548
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:19,574
call me.

549
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:23,502
I'll be there, okay?

550
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,034
Thank you.

551
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:51,794
Listen.

552
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:54,963
I hold the candle for ten minutes, then with the excuse of the little girl I go back.

553
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,233
Okay, okay.

554
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,131
Is it allowed?

555
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,532
- Good evening, Salome. - Good evening.

556
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:09,621
Ricardo and I were wondering if you guys would like to have a drink at the club?

557
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:11,051
Now?

558
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:15,651
Yes, now. Someone has to stand guard during curfew.

559
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,677
- So, at the club in ten minutes? - Yeah, fine.

560
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:21,721
- Yes? - Yes, come on.

561
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,076
- Good. - See you soon.

562
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:28,104
What do I wear?

563
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:31,399
I don't know if I can do it, I took two sleeping pills.

564
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:33,647
It's only half an hour, a beer, darling, you're so old.

565
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:37,232
- What should I wear? What should I wear? - But what if they came in pajamas and slippers?

566
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:39,455
- Are we going like this? - No, we're dressing up.

567
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,881
Like this? Without anything?

568
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:44,119
- Come on, wake up. - I really don't feel like it.

569
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:47,010
What do you say, put some hairspray in your hair and let's go.

570
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:17,696
Ainhoa.

571
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:22,150
The arm.

572
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:26,612
I'm going to shit myself. I have to go to the bathroom, I'm going to shit myself.

573
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,377
Ainhoa.

574
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,461
- What the hell! - I'm sorry.

575
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,088
Sorry. I'm going to shit myself.

576
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:14,308
What a beautiful fabric.

577
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:17,079
- There they are, my goodness. - They're dressed, see?

578
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:20,680
-Shall we change? -What's changing? We have to stay a moment.

579
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,167
HI.

580
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:28,854
- Good evening. - Hi.

581
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:31,572
So? Let's have a drink, shall we?

582
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,260
Julian!

583
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:45,016
- You're breaking the counter. Give it to me. - What?

584
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:48,619
- I'll check if I have a bottle opener in the kitchen. - Okay.

585
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:55,372
I... put on some music,

586
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:58,489
let's throw a party...

587
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:00,150
with bells and whistles!

588
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:09,887
HI.

589
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,496
- I have to, damn it. - Okay. What happened?

590
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,247
What happened?

591
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,473
- Ainhoa ​​has arrived in the room. - Yes?

592
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:21,421
- Yes, and we talked on the cot. - Good.

593
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:22,928
He hugged me,

594
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:25,425
to sleep. And he kissed me.

595
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:27,898
- Perfect. - On the cheek,

596
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:29,854
he gave me a kiss on the cheek.

597
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:32,958
You got it all wrong.

598
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:36,674
You just became his teddy bear.

599
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:39,245
-Didn't you tell me you were nice? -Yes...

600
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,560
but with friends, nice with friends, damn.

601
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,380
- Let's finish this. Let's finish this. - How do we finish this?

602
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:46,759
New plan...

603
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:49,598
- Go back inside and try it on with her, right now. - No.

604
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:52,439
Yes. Or tomorrow you will be the invisible man.

605
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:56,893
- Okay. - Come on.

606
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:59,401
Shit. I stepped in the puddle.

607
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:04,015
- Leave the puddle alone. - What disgusting things they are, damn it.

608
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:36,662
What are you doing here?

609
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:41,395
- If my father sees you here, he'll... - This is the only place...

610
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:43,686
when your father won't come looking for me.

611
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:47,315
I can?

612
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,322
- Bye bye.

613
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:34,498
By the time I find music, it will be out of fashion.

614
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,167
Do you want me to go look for something?

615
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
No.

616
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:49,028
It's just that I took some sleeping pills.

617
00:41:01,504 --> 00:41:04,241
I don't know why I'm asking, but...

618
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:11,655
How do you apologize to a daughter you've been an idiot to?

619
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:17,468
I'm going down as a father,

620
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:21,452
the ship sinks...

621
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:25,454
Julia.

622
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:28,626
Julia.

623
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,147
Excuse me.

624
00:41:53,623 --> 00:41:58,458
I'm sorry, but at night all the cabins are the same.

625
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,049
Put a blanket on, it's cold, okay?

626
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:31,943
- Ulises, where are you going? - Leave me alone.

627
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:34,299
- Wait, wait. What's up? - It's over, Piti.

628
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:39,058
If she wants to be with that idiot, okay, I'm nobody's spare tire.

629
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,671
Salome!

630
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:54,857
Salome!

631
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,605
- What's wrong? Is she drunk? - No. She fell asleep.

632
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:03,931
- And you? What do you do? - We couldn't agree on the CD and...

633
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,375
- speaking... I'll get dressed and come. - No. Leave it alone.

634
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,459
- No, what? - Go to hell, Julian.

635
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:10,606
- Ricardo. - Go to hell.

636
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:12,143
Ricardo, thank you.

637
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:07,726
Papi.

638
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:11,978
Is he sleeping with us?

639
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,382
Yes, darling. He sleeps with us.

640
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:17,180
Forever?

641
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:23,463
No, darling, just tonight because she's very tired. Come on,

642
00:44:23,488 --> 00:44:26,420
Keep sleeping, it's late. Come on.

643
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,817
Sleep, sleep. Wrap up warm.

644
00:44:29,142 --> 00:44:30,142
Cos�.

645
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:37,157
- Dad. - What's up?

646
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,884
Wouldn't you like him to sleep with us forever?

647
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:54,379
Yes I would like that, darling,

648
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:56,648
but let it remain a secret between me and you.

649
00:44:58,283 --> 00:45:00,206
Come on, keep sleeping.

650
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,575
Cover yourself well.

651
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:36,786
Or leave Ainhoa ​​alone...

652
00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:40,978
or one day you'll wake up in one of those sinking boxes.

653
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,273
Ah, what?

654
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:46,384
And how can you put me in a box if I break your legs?

655
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,599
I've already warned you once, this is the second.

656
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:00,353
There will not be a third.

657
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,722
I have some good news and some bad news for you.

658
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:14,111
The good thing is that, at the moment, I'm not interested in Ainhoa.

659
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,253
That bad one...

660
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,608
I often change my mind.

661
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:35,079
Very good.

662
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:46,626
Never threaten someone with a gun if you don't intend to use it.

663
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:20,201
And the hippos?

664
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:22,760
Leave it on the first table, Embolo.

665
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:53,324
- Embolus! - What the fuck is going on?

666
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,397
The ship is moving.

667
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,349
What's happening? Are you okay?

668
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,456
- Ricardo, what the fuck is going on? - The tide is rising and it's crushing us.

669
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,824
Tell everyone to leave the cabins.

670
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:16,647
- Attention, everyone out of the cabins! - Everyone out!

671
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:19,731
Everyone out of the cabins!

672
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:21,665
Join the club.

673
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,376
And hand out the life jackets, come on.

674
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,415
Quick!

675
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:33,683
Come to my cabin in two minutes.

676
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:47,833
Don't rush. Keep calm.

677
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:51,611
I want the sea state and wind speed, now!

678
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:55,076
The situation is this.

679
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,473
The ship is too stuck and the tide can't move us.

680
00:48:58,593 --> 00:49:02,439
If we don't free ourselves in twenty minutes, the high tide will break the hull in two.

681
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:07,905
And couldn't you have thought of that before, instead of drinking and fucking while the ship sinks?

682
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,142
Ricardo.

683
00:49:12,443 --> 00:49:13,443
Ricardo.

684
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:15,494
Well.

685
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:17,991
The ship is in the balance.

686
00:49:18,003 --> 00:49:20,846
The hold and these two compartments are watertight.

687
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:24,455
If we flood them, the weight will rock us and we may break free.

688
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,750
Ricardo, no, I think, I mean...

689
00:49:26,942 --> 00:49:29,683
the pressure of the water, entering, will carry away these two walls,

690
00:49:29,703 --> 00:49:32,207
- and the whole ship would break apart. - Those walls will hold.

691
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:35,181
Shall we have a drink to see if he's right this time?

692
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:39,598
What solutions does she have? What the fuck can she do?

693
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:42,572
- Please. Please. - Enough, enough, enough.

694
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,446
Let's calm down, okay?

695
00:49:51,952 --> 00:49:53,801
The captain is right.

696
00:49:54,148 --> 00:49:59,288
The ship is designed to stay afloat with both holds flooded.

697
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:00,807
Well.

698
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:05,125
We'll empty the compartments and open a crack in the hull, from the inside.

699
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:09,031
If we act quickly, we'll be able to free ourselves before it floods. Is that clear?

700
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:21,978
Come on, guys, come on, get some rhythm.

701
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:27,616
- Come on, guys, come on, come on. - Small boxes first, okay?

702
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:30,812
Come on, guys, come on.

703
00:50:32,994 --> 00:50:34,664
Be careful with the poles.

704
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:36,839
Watch out, up there!

705
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,496
- Everyone get out of here! Out! - Let's go on deck!

706
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:42,980
- Out! Quickly! - All hands on deck!

707
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:45,326
Captain, captain, wait, I can't move.

708
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:49,119
- Please, take it off me, please. - Relax, son, we'll get you out.

709
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:53,369
Wait, wait, please, please.

710
00:51:01,427 --> 00:51:02,507
That's it.

711
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:13,518
The door.

712
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:15,503
The door. Why doesn't it open?

713
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,068
Push!

714
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:21,119
Push!

715
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:25,518
- Push. Come on. - It won't open from here, I can't do it.

716
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:27,124
- Try again. - Why doesn't it open?

717
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:29,686
- Push hard! - It won't open!

718
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:38,549
Ricardo.

719
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,105
The hull.

720
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:43,339
I won't last more than five minutes.

721
00:51:43,711 --> 00:51:45,473
It's impossible.

722
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:47,859
Pap�.

723
00:51:49,562 --> 00:51:52,670
- Dad. Dad. - Ainhoa, let me do it for a moment.

724
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,656
Move away from the door. I'll try to open it.

725
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,044
Give it your all, Ulises.

726
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:02,049
Ulises, stop.

727
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,601
Julia.

728
00:52:05,842 --> 00:52:10,404
If you break the door, we'll flood the entire ship along with the hold.

729
00:52:13,637 --> 00:52:15,968
There would be no hope for anyone.

730
00:52:16,787 --> 00:52:17,832
Pap�.

731
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:21,854
They have a circular saw in there, tell them they can break the door.

732
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:23,495
What the hell do you want to do?

733
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:26,234
Ricardo...

734
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,392
Better three than forty, right?

735
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:32,763
- We have to act quickly. - What does three mean?

736
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:35,061
Captain, open the door, please.

737
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:40,333
Open the door! I'm twenty. There must be another solution, please.

738
00:52:40,372 --> 00:52:41,811
- Please. - Dad.

739
00:52:41,814 --> 00:52:45,293
- That's enough. - Calm down, damn it.

740
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:46,489
Stay calm.

741
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,565
Ulises says you have a circular saw and you can break the door.

742
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:51,601
Honey, if we do this...

743
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:53,344
we will all die.

744
00:52:53,348 --> 00:52:57,147
You won't die, we will survive on the lifeboats.

745
00:52:58,816 --> 00:53:02,788
You brought Valeria and me here to be together, remember?

746
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:07,720
So go out and keep your promise.

747
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:08,980
You go out.

748
00:53:10,138 --> 00:53:13,233
Open the door, damn it.

749
00:53:13,249 --> 00:53:15,403
I'm sorry, little sparrow, but...

750
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:18,147
we have no other choice.

751
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:21,383
Go away, come on.

752
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:23,319
No.

753
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,623
Let us out.

754
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:27,697
Please.

755
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:29,065
Please let us out.

756
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:31,507
- No. - Let us out, please.

757
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:32,697
Please.

758
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:33,918
Ainhoa.

759
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,173
Please.

760
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:37,649
Please.

761
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,017
Would you rather starve out there?

762
00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:52,932
We are talking about sacrificing the lives of three people.

763
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:55,150
The life of three people,

764
00:53:55,182 --> 00:53:56,529
or of all.

765
00:53:56,631 --> 00:54:00,604
- You heard the captain. - Just a moment. We heard.

766
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:02,575
But over there there is Piti, for example.

767
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:05,448
- What will become of him? - What would you like us to do?

768
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,496
Either his or ours.

769
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:09,521
Don't make us feel guilty.

770
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:12,163
It's our lives. But precisely for this reason...

771
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:15,387
- We have to think. - There's nothing we can do.

772
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:17,699
There's nothing we can do to save them.

773
00:54:17,715 --> 00:54:18,873
Julian.

774
00:54:19,274 --> 00:54:20,421
It's me.

775
00:54:20,576 --> 00:54:23,037
Please tell me something.

776
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,243
Please.

777
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:27,269
Julian, please.

778
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:29,958
I know you hear me, please.

779
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,943
You have to think clearly.

780
00:54:39,558 --> 00:54:44,105
If the wind continues to blow from the west, when it reaches 20 knots we hoist the sails.

781
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,698
Gentlemen, just a moment.

782
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:53,508
There is another way to get the ship out.

783
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:56,962
We can reverse it out.

784
00:54:57,512 --> 00:54:58,766
It's possible.

785
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:14,431
- Wait, wait. - What's up?

786
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:16,655
- We're safe. - What are you saying?

787
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:19,749
Oxygen, we have oxygen.

788
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:23,098
We can pierce the hull...

789
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:27,214
and pass us the respirator while we make a hole big enough to get out.

790
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:29,212
Right, Captain?

791
00:55:31,747 --> 00:55:33,623
That's right, isn't it?

792
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,770
I'm afraid not, son.

793
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:40,433
As soon as we open the crack...

794
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:45,088
we are left without electricity.

795
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:49,156
We won't have time to make a hole big enough.

796
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:52,290
What does he say?

797
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,620
I'm sorry, son.

798
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,517
Ainhoa.

799
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,729
Here I am, dad.

800
00:56:32,064 --> 00:56:33,226
Ainhoa...

801
00:56:35,262 --> 00:56:37,860
I wanted to apologize for last night.

802
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:41,961
Because I was an idiot.

803
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,036
For treating you like this.

804
00:56:47,468 --> 00:56:50,041
As if I were still a child.

805
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:58,938
It doesn't matter why...

806
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,460
because I want you to scold me a thousand times.

807
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:10,593
Because I will be wrong a thousand times.

808
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,598
And I want you to ground me.

809
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,978
And I want to argue and then apologize to you.

810
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:27,706
Now you will have to take care of your sister again.

811
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:30,413
Don't make her cry.

812
00:57:38,218 --> 00:57:40,531
Tell her I went to look for her mother.

813
00:57:42,509 --> 00:57:44,561
A million miles away.

814
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:51,516
He told you.

815
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:02,171
Tell her that...

816
00:58:03,123 --> 00:58:04,894
which will take a while.

817
00:58:08,413 --> 00:58:10,303
Don't wait for me.

818
00:58:12,346 --> 00:58:14,798
I'll wait for you.

819
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,517
Are you crazy?

820
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:33,449
With the wind at your head you will break the mainmast.

821
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,130
Or we'll turn upside down.

822
00:58:35,146 --> 00:58:38,665
It's the only way to save them without flooding the hold.

823
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:40,926
If we allow the captain...

824
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:43,499
and From the Block...

825
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:47,215
drown down there... we're all dead.

826
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:51,085
- We can run the ship without them. - No.

827
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:53,365
No, because tomorrow it could be you.

828
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,081
Either you, or you, or you stay down there.

829
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:00,749
If they die...

830
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:03,032
if we put a price on their lives...

831
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,028
our lives will no longer have any value.

832
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,459
Here we are, Julian.

833
00:59:32,713 --> 00:59:34,629
How much time has passed?

834
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,017
Eighteen years old?

835
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:39,145
Winds.

836
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:43,884
It was a great honor, Ricardo.

837
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:48,149
Damn.

838
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:01,293
- Julian. - Tell me.

839
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:07,408
How are you, son?

840
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:10,634
Scared to death.

841
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:14,492
If there is any chance of saving them, we must try.

842
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,733
Enough now!

843
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:24,883
- The decision has been made. - No!

844
01:00:28,432 --> 01:00:30,028
There are elections today.

845
01:00:30,143 --> 01:00:33,359
Here we decide democratically who is in charge.

846
01:00:39,787 --> 01:00:42,039
I'm running for office.

847
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:46,009
Gentlemen...

848
01:00:47,341 --> 01:00:49,026
Here's my vote.

849
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:19,676
My father said I would be nothing.

850
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:21,758
Instead...

851
01:01:22,143 --> 01:01:24,542
Thanks to me, humanity still has hope.

852
01:01:27,473 --> 01:01:28,813
Great, boy.

853
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:30,624
Big.

854
01:01:37,888 --> 01:01:39,262
Julian.

855
01:01:39,576 --> 01:01:41,562
Come on, tell me something.

856
01:01:41,566 --> 01:01:44,083
Tell me something, I know you hear me.

857
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,355
Please, Julian.

858
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:48,912
Please.

859
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:06,562
Julian, please.

860
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:09,229
Answers?

861
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:11,824
Or are you going to buy cigarettes this time?

862
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:50,012
Salome.

863
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:56,680
You once asked me...

864
01:02:57,382 --> 01:02:59,375
why I left that house.

865
01:02:59,439 --> 01:03:00,548
Memories?

866
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:02,186
S�.

867
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,404
It was because...

868
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:08,036
I was kidding myself.

869
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:09,726
You know it?

870
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:13,725
Because I never really loved her, because...

871
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,166
because I was in love with you.

872
01:03:22,117 --> 01:03:23,652
I love you.

873
01:03:26,923 --> 01:03:28,447
Me too.

874
01:03:33,046 --> 01:03:34,453
One more thing.

875
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,708
I have always loved you.

876
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,297
Over and out, baby.

877
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:49,611
No...

878
01:03:49,938 --> 01:03:51,181
no...

879
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:15,673
Force.

880
01:06:41,286 --> 01:06:43,215
The mayor is Ulises.

881
01:07:02,726 --> 01:07:04,760
- We have to hurry. - Come on.

882
01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:06,567
It does not work.

883
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:13,402
The captain is speaking. We're out of power in the hold. What's going on?

884
01:07:14,314 --> 01:07:16,731
Captain, this is the mayor of the ship speaking.

885
01:07:16,735 --> 01:07:19,502
My first mission will be to save you.

886
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:22,043
Hold on tight because we're going to do some dancing.

887
01:07:22,254 --> 01:07:23,893
Dai, Ulises, dai.

888
01:07:23,925 --> 01:07:26,723
It turns out he's really your son.

889
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,550
Dai, Ulises.

890
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:40,764
- Put it right. - All right.

891
01:07:49,127 --> 01:07:50,324
Dovecotes.

892
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:52,616
Tell me the wind speed.

893
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:55,357
Sixteen knots, and counting.

894
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:57,084
Let's set sail.

895
01:07:58,111 --> 01:07:59,349
Okay, wait.

896
01:07:59,397 --> 01:08:02,805
Wait before setting sail, we need more wind.

897
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:03,957
Received.

898
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:05,231
- Ramiro. - S�?

899
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:07,378
- Reverse, full speed. - All right.

900
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:10,341
Reverse gear.

901
01:08:49,263 --> 01:08:51,169
Doctor, is the breast free?

902
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:53,692
You can't see anything in the rearview mirrors.

903
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:00,906
Free.

904
01:09:01,436 --> 01:09:05,342
- Palomares, wind speed. - Twenty knots, and increasing.

905
01:09:05,343 --> 01:09:06,643
Okay, wait.

906
01:09:11,305 --> 01:09:12,997
Twenty-one knots.

907
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:19,749
Twenty-two.

908
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,630
Ventitr�.

909
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:34,186
- Twenty-four knots. - Keep going, guys.

910
01:09:35,622 --> 01:09:37,038
Twenty-five knots.

911
01:09:40,283 --> 01:09:43,047
- Twenty-six knots. - Now. Set sail.

912
01:09:43,064 --> 01:09:44,304
Now.

913
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:04,474
If the ship doesn't leave immediately, we will sink.

914
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:07,419
- Stop the engines. - No, don't stop the engines.

915
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:12,019
You're doing well, guys.

916
01:10:18,262 --> 01:10:20,467
Is this the best you can do?

917
01:10:21,839 --> 01:10:24,476
Ulises, good God, what are you waiting for?

918
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:28,404
Stop the engines, Ulises.

919
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,609
Force...

920
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:31,600
What are you waiting for?

921
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,422
I'm waiting for this.

922
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:48,193
Man of little faith.

923
01:10:59,295 --> 01:11:00,835
We got out of trouble.

924
01:11:04,502 --> 01:11:06,800
- We're floating. - We're sailing.

925
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,441
We are sailing.

926
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:10,614
We are safe.

927
01:11:23,339 --> 01:11:24,905
- We're safe. - Great, boy.

928
01:11:25,006 --> 01:11:26,714
We are safe.

929
01:11:51,696 --> 01:11:53,185
Where the fuck are we?

930
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:55,824
- Why doesn't the compass point north? - I don't know.

931
01:11:55,828 --> 01:11:59,184
Perhaps we are in an area of ​​extreme magnetic virulence.

932
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,208
Guard.

933
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:05,536
If that man is there, there must be other ships, right?

934
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:08,992
Someone stole the tranquilizers.

935
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:11,552
Who the fuck would do something like that?

936
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,735
I remind you that a few days ago he was about to kill your father.

937
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:20,207
I'm mad at you because you killed a boy, you son of a bitch.

938
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:21,762
Don't look at me...

939
01:12:22,063 --> 01:12:24,014
and don't talk to me.

940
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:26,712
"The island is no longer there." "There is no land."

941
01:12:26,744 --> 01:12:28,608
"Australia is not there."

942
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:30,007
You're crazy.

943
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:31,131
Stop.

944
01:12:31,437 --> 01:12:32,941
Leave me.

945
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:36,220
My dad likes someone on the ship too.

946
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,820
What's going on, Julia? Why is it night at 9:15 in the morning?

947
01:12:41,836 --> 01:12:45,275
- The sun? - Without land we can live, but...

948
01:12:45,308 --> 01:12:46,567
Without the sun?

949
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:49,695
