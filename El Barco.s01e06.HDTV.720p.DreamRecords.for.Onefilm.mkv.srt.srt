1
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,210
Ricardo, come.

2
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,100
Captain, something's happening.

3
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,220
We're going more than ten knots with the engines off and it's not the wind pushing us.

4
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,660
I know. It's a current that's dragging us along.

5
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,780
Lower all sails.

6
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,060
And what kind of current drags a 500-ton ship in the middle of the ocean?

7
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,360
I have no idea.

8
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,260
It'll be another consequence of the particle cataclysm, damn it.

9
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,110
The fact is that we are going at full speed.

10
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,040
The cataclysm, right?

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,650
Any ideas, son?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,180
The wind has nothing to do with it here.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,490
Stay the course. I'm going to talk to the doctor.

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
All right.

15
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,050
We have to stop the ship.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,570
If something appears up there, we won't have time to maneuver, you know.

17
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:27,150
There's nothing out there to crash into,

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,770
Do I need to remind you?

19
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,850
So be quiet and obey the captain's orders.

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,900
On your marks. Bear down and burn, come on.

21
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,900
My father says that in life,

22
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:44,490
There is always someone who commands and someone who obeys.

23
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,270
My mother was in charge of me, and when she went to heaven,

24
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,090
Miss Maica was in charge.

25
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:58,090
And now that he's not there, Ahinoa is in charge.

26
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:00,620
Land in sight, Captain. Do you see it?

27
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,760
- Yes, I see it. - What do we do?

28
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,270
But I also have authority over someone.

29
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,500
Embolo, batten down the hatches and wind at your back.

30
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,360
Yes, Captain. Hatches closed.

31
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:13,480
Lower the jib.

32
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,960
And full speed ahead.

33
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,110
- Set the mainsail. - Ready to board!

34
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,240
Yes, Captain.

35
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:28,300
Even though dad says there's always someone who's bossing around,

36
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,210
I know there are people who don't like taking orders.

37
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,720
Damn, a cookie.

38
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,240
Are we celebrating something, Salome? Is there a party?

39
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:41,480
I'm sorry, darling, it's not easy for me, or for you, or for anyone.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,080
We're not celebrating anything, Piti. We're just plain hungry.

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,590
I'm getting pissed off, we've been eating bread and water for two days.

42
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:54,960
- And two minutes each for the shower. - I ask you for a little patience.

43
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,715
There's nothing we can do about it.

44
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:59,019
We don't know how much longer we'll have to stay at sea.

45
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,090
- What do you want? - People get angry when they're hungry.

46
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,670
- Do you see anyone happy? - Please.

47
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,840
'Fuck the captain's rationing.

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,050
I've been up since 4 this morning.

49
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,140
Sailor, let this be the last time you make a scene like that in my mess hall.

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,620
Doctor.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,390
- Doctor, I need to talk to you. - I'm taking a shower, Captain.

52
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:28,600
- I'll be out in a moment. - There's no time.

53
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,630
I need to know why the ocean that covers half the planet is dragging us along.

54
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,430
What?

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,110
We lowered the sails.

56
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,637
- That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. - Give it here.

57
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,400
I don't know what the hell is out there.

58
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,650
See something? Leave it and go outside.

59
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,450
Shit.

60
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,940
At that time?

61
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,930
Reel!

62
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,200
We're heading straight for a whirlpool. Dad!

63
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,730
Dai, dai!

64
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,085
Whirlpool! It's a whirlpool, and we're falling into it.

65
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:20,307
Turn to starboard.

66
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,720
Steer as hard to port as you can or she'll swallow us up!

67
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,590
Shut up and let me do my job.

68
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,490
Engines full reverse. This is an emergency maneuver.

69
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,770
Engines full reverse.

70
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,090
- At this speed we'll break in two. - Shut up.

71
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,460
- Full speed ahead. - Shut up.

72
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,690
We have to get out of the whirlpool.

73
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,180
Gentlemen, full speed ahead.

74
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,380
- What the hell are you doing? - Listen.

75
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,240
- What's up? - Dad, listen to me for a moment.

76
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,890
For once in your life,

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
listen to me, please.

78
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
Full speed ahead.

79
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,950
- Countermand, full speed ahead. - What?

80
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,920
You heard, countermand, full speed ahead, go ahead!

81
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,830
Damn, I can't do it.

82
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,860
The oceans are healing.

83
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,340
Imagine millions of cubic tons of water jostling for space.

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,720
I resisted.

85
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,300
At this rate we'll break the rudder blade.

86
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,950
Come on, beautiful, hold on, hold on.

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,379
The temperature of the planet that regulates the currents has changed.

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,220
And this is just the beginning.

89
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,610
Force.

90
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,400
Force.

91
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,580
- Ulises... - Hang in there, we'll get past him.

92
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,600
Resist, resist.

93
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,270
We got over it.

94
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,760
We got over it, Dad.

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
You sure are stubborn. I...

96
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,869
I'll break your...

97
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,640
- It's true that you are my son. - I told you.

98
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
I told you.

99
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,756
- Is everything okay? - Yes.

100
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,233
I'm sorry, excuse me.

101
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,558
Is everyone okay?

102
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,480
- Is he okay? - Yes.

107
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,020
At that time?

108
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,250
I checked this entire area and the hull shows no damage.

109
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:45,050
But the keel is stuck in a huge rock, from here to here.

110
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,030
The ship is in the balance.

111
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:52,660
Wait.

112
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,670
My God. She's listing to starboard.

113
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:03,262
A wave to port would capsize the ship and we would sink.

114
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,610
- Manuel, start the engines. - No. Absolutely not.

115
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,560
If we push the ship while we are stuck in the rock,

116
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,159
- He'll cut himself like a can. - And you propose to stay here?

117
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:17,293
A treacherous sea wave would split us in two like a walnut.

118
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,410
Any other metaphors?

119
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,380
Manuel, start the engines.

120
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:28,300
- 1400 rpm. - He's making a mistake.

121
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,130
1500. More, Manuel, it increases.

122
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,880
1600 rpm, increase, Manuel.

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,320
Increase!

126
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,850
- I'll split the ship in two, Captain. - Ulises!

127
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,690
I'll split the ship in two, Captain.

128
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,530
Agree.

129
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,290
I want cargo and crew as counterweight on the port side or we'll capsize.

130
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,860
We will wait for the tide.

131
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,070
If there are still tides at all.

132
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,050
Enough, please, enough!

133
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,350
What the hell is going on?

134
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:35,740
Enough, please, enough!

135
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,470
Silence!

136
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,180
Doctor, we have a problem.

137
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,950
Silence, I said!

138
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:50,780
- I can't now, Embolo. - No, please, it's Valeria, she's in the infirmary.

139
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,490
Let's go.

140
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,010
We want to know what's going on, Captain.

141
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,660
We ran aground.

142
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,740
We have to wait 12 hours for the tide to bring us back up to the surface.

143
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,420
Non cos, De la Cuadra?

144
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,780
Yes, indeed.

145
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,870
It looks like a clear fracture,

146
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,693
but I don't think I can save him.

147
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,370
I will have to have a transplant.

148
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,470
- It was my fault. - Will it hurt him?

149
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:30,490
No, darling. He's a brave little bear.

150
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,830
And then, I anesthetized him,

151
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,570
and no, it won't hurt him, you'll see.

152
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,480
Give me a needle and some fabric.

153
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,420
Fico doesn't like stings,

154
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,790
but if you sing he doesn't cry.

155
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Ah, what?

156
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,800
We see.

157
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:00,572
Don't look, Valeria.

<i>But if she sleeps I'll bring her</i> <i>an apricot, sweet sweet.</i>

164
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,840
All crew will move to the port cabins to provide counterweight.

165
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:34,501
Water remains limited, as does the use of electronic devices.

166
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:35,867
But how...

167
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:37,088
Captain!

168
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,900
And where are we going to take a shit?

169
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,910
Whoever needs to empty their ass, get your ass overboard.

170
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,970
- But to port. - Captain,

171
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:55,570
He gives us a biscuit for breakfast, now he wants to herd us like animals without water.

172
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,660
And what do those who don't want to do?

173
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,100
It's true, Captain. He doesn't take us into consideration.

174
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,850
And nobody asked us anything.

175
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,950
A ship is not a condominium.

176
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:07,047
But not even a dictatorship where they tell you when to go to the bathroom, captain.

177
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:09,440
- Exactly. - Exactly.

178
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,620
Did you decide?

179
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:14,100
- The boys are not wrong. - Some of you are capable,

180
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,530
to ration food so as not to die in two days?

181
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,540
I volunteer.

182
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,180
Captain, those who put you in command are no longer there.

183
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,620
And we didn't choose it.

184
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,700
I propose that we call elections.

185
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,860
Yes. Elections!

186
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:42,110
Elections! Elections!

187
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,960
- Silence! - Elections! Elections!

188
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,510
I just placed an order!

189
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,430
I don't want any more debates or meetings.

190
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,780
Ten o'clock, everyone's curfew. I don't want any trouble.

191
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,610
Go.

192
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Didn't you hear me? Come on, hurry up.

193
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,130
Get out of here.

194
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,540
Didn't you hear me?

195
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,130
That's it.

196
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,100
- Do you have children? - No.

197
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,030
But I wish I had a little girl like you.

198
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,550
Come on, come on.

199
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,530
Did you hear? He wants a little girl like me.

200
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,900
Girls, don't change rooms.

201
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,440
Guys, the group is breaking up. They're all moving to the port side,

202
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,499
by order of his excellency the captain.

203
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:20,994
We won't get anything this way.

204
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,015
But at least we'll have mixed dormitories.

205
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,542
- Guys. - Look on the bright side.

206
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,017
- The mattresses. - Listen, Palomares, one thing.

207
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,898
You priests... do you have erections?

208
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:33,399
You're stupid.

209
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:36,279
It was a curiosity. Palomares...

210
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:40,784
Ainhoa.

211
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:44,315
I wanted to explain to you what happened with your father...

212
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,181
- What? - Yes, sir.

213
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:55,565
He's hanging on your every word, isn't he?

214
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,494
Don't take it personally, Ulises, but...

215
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,985
If you like Ahinoa, you're in trouble.

216
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:01,625
Stop it, Piti.

217
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,241
I can do it alone, I don't need help.

218
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:05,600
Thank you.

219
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,057
Okay, okay.

220
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:11,059
You take speedboats in storms, you dive 100 meters for a black box,

221
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,460
but then, you like a girl and you let a scoundrel like Gamboa take her.

222
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,835
You just have to get used to it.

223
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,435
Wait.

224
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,621
Did you ask Ainhoa ​​if she likes you?

225
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,889
Listen, I'll give you some advice.

226
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,555
Ed � free.

227
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,646
You be careful...

228
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,871
if he turns to look at you as you walk away after you've talked.

229
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:40,329
Because if she does... it means she likes you.

230
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,580
Ed cos Ulysses, cos

231
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,132
Notice that detail, notice it.

232
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,474
And what the hell do you have against my father?

233
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:08,405
You question him, you turn everyone against him, and on top of that you call for elections to replace him.

234
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:11,620
Do you think he'll listen to me if I send him a written complaint?

235
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:14,384
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

236
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,592
You want his place.

237
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:19,286
What, you think you're a better captain than him?

238
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,459
No.

239
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,160
But he became a tyrant.

240
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,620
Curfews, rationing, cuts.

241
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,623
He gives no explanations, he takes no one into consideration.

242
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,571
My father is not a dictator, so stop doing that.

243
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:32,984
I know.

244
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:36,073
What I'm doing is for his own good.

245
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,903
In the corridors there is already talk of getting rid of him.

246
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,350
To see him dead.

247
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:46,763
- Who? Who? - Nobody. Nobody.

248
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:48,942
Everyone, no one, gossip.

249
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,395
If your father doesn't loosen the rope...

250
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,095
they will use it to hang him.

251
00:16:57,088 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm simply giving him a chance to legitimize himself.

252
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,478
Believe me.

253
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,255
Believe me.

254
00:17:27,684 --> 00:17:30,246
If only the solution were as easy as...

255
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,649
put a wish in a bottle and throw it into the sea.

256
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,859
- Stop, stop. - No. No.

257
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,386
No, please.

258
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:28,167
Please, please.

259
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,280
Get out of here immediately.

260
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm not going out. You go out and close the door, please.

261
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:54,870
Come on, go back to your cabin. Let's go.

262
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,277
Come on, I won't tell you again.

263
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,690
- Get out of here. - Leave me alone.

264
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,016
Let's go.

265
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:36,529
Captain.

266
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:38,513
You have to come to the classroom, it's urgent.

267
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,034
Pap�!

268
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:43,357
Captain, come to the courtroom immediately. It's urgent.

269
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,207
- That's a problem. - Dad!

270
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,656
I'm here darling, what's going on?

271
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,545
I can't open the door.

272
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:50,075
Did you lock it again?

273
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:51,689
- No. - What the hell is going on?

274
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,932
Help me, she's stuck.

275
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,221
Valeria, darling.

276
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:57,050
Move away from the door, now let's push hard, okay?

277
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:58,915
- Okay. - Come on.

278
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,999
One, two and three.

279
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,536
Damn!

280
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,381
Ricardo, leave it to me.

281
00:20:08,397 --> 00:20:10,291
Valeria, stay aside.

282
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,739
Valeria, darling.

283
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,809
I've told you a thousand times not to close the door when you're alone.

284
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,355
Are you OK?

285
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:25,632
Come on, it's all okay, darling. It's over.

286
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,951
So you know for next time.

287
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:29,283
Ricardo.

288
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,622
- Come. - Wait here a moment.

289
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,097
What happens?

290
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,418
Steel.

291
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:37,986
It is giving way under the pressure of the water.

292
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,962
The ship is crashing, Ricardo.

293
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:52,877
They called a strike.

294
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,316
They say they won't get up until I call elections.

295
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,662
Elections?

296
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:58,350
'Fuck democracy.

297
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:00,297
- Everybody stand up, for God's sake. - Stand up.

298
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,324
What happens?

299
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,313
What's the matter with you?

300
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,463
You want to put a brat in charge? Will he sink the ship?

301
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:08,616
Come on, everybody stand up.

302
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,686
You heard me. Come on, everybody stand up.

303
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,853
You. Stand up.

304
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:15,949
Stand up, what the fuck.

305
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:18,543
- Stand up, you piece of... - All right, all right.

306
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,189
- Don't touch us! - All right, all right.

307
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:30,175
Everybody stand up.

308
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,763
Captain.

309
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,619
Is this how things are done on the ship now, by shouting and pushing?

310
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:51,625
I'm sorry, but not like that.

311
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:55,470
- What are you doing? - Don't touch me.

312
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,727
Ricardo.

313
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:13,054
Maybe they're right.

314
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:14,919
Nobody talks about commanding the ship,

315
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,384
but only of civil life, everyday things.

316
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,520
And for this, the majority's approval is needed.

317
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,664
Tomorrow between 8:00 and 12:00 in the morning,

318
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:37,386
Voting will take place to elect a...

319
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:41,645
mayor.

320
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:48,175
Until then, the orders remain the same.

321
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:16,532
What did I tell you?

322
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:19,024
What if he turned to look at you...

323
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,395
Do you need help or not?

324
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:24,828
Come on, come on.

325
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:04,063
Julia and Salome have already taken possession of my cabin.

326
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:08,274
You know what Salome says? That she doesn't want to change the sheets.

327
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:11,130
Because he says they know about me. How do you interpret that?

328
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:14,601
He's losing his sense of smell. Hurry up. And be quiet, you'll wake the little girl.

329
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,045
Let's go to sleep.

330
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:24,130
Step aside.

331
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,503
Step aside.

332
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,495
Do you think she's in love?

333
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,693
I caught Ainhoa ​​in the cabin with Gamboa.

334
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:43,460
Naked.

335
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,082
Damn.

336
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,861
And what did you do?

337
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,216
I threw her out into the hallway, like a Taliban.

338
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,299
Dragging her by the arm.

339
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:57,324
In your underwear.

340
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:10,069
Well, damn it, what else were you supposed to do?

341
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:12,814
Excuse me.

342
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,255
Close the door and leave.

343
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:56,716
<i>If anyone finds this note, don't lose your smile.</i>

344
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,248
<i>There is still life and hope on the North Star.</i>

345
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:33,988
Let's go. Listen, Ulises.

346
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:36,624
You can tell a girl you like her a thousand times.

347
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,874
But until a friend tells him, he doesn't even see you.

348
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:40,263
- He doesn't even see you. - Wait.

349
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:41,816
Is this why I have to sleep with them?

350
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:42,980
- Right. - No.

351
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:46,579
Sneer at them a little, be nice. And smile. Always smile.

352
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:50,062
What do you do outside the cabin?

353
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:52,905
It's 10:30 PM and there's a curfew.

354
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:54,352
I have to report.

355
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:55,985
You are absolutely right.

356
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:59,725
No, you can't report me, Embolo.

357
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:02,113
Because I... am from the Canary Islands.

358
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:03,473
We are an hour behind.

359
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:05,694
So I still have about half an hour.

360
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,696
And that blanket?

361
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:16,636
I'm a little chilly.

362
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,669
Okay.

363
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:22,109
Wait. No, listen...

364
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:30,045
Do you know what a particle accelerator is?

365
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:35,445
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, when we have a moment, I'll explain it to you.

366
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:37,265
Come on, goodnight.

367
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,566
What's up?

368
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,460
I've never spoken to any of them.

369
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:43,276
- Today is the opportunity. - No, today is not...

370
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:45,076
- Yes it is. - No. Today...

371
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:49,416
Sorry, girls. Do you have a place for Ulises?

372
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,004
The poor guy was left without a cabin, and was about to go to sleep in the hold.

373
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,909
- In the hold? - Yes.

374
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:56,241
It does not matter.

375
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,773
With how cold it is.

376
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,815
That's what I say too.

377
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,121
Well, if you want, stay here.

378
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:03,881
I think Ainhoa ​​won't come.

379
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:06,332
You could have said that before, couldn't you, darling?

380
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:09,402
Excuse me.

381
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:12,094
Excuse me.

382
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:14,312
Thank you so much, everyone.

383
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:15,469
Too kind.

384
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,290
Good night, ladies.

385
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,045
It's cold, huh?

386
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,723
Well...

387
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:32,854
- Good night. - Good night.

388
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,563
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

389
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:53,665
She told me you weren't coming. Right?

390
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:58,192
Don't worry, I'm going to the hold. I'll get my things and...

391
00:28:58,193 --> 00:28:59,363
- I'm going to the hold. - No.

392
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:02,060
- Seriously. - Seriously, no.

393
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,242
Subtract with me.

394
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:10,791
All right.

395
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,577
Ricardo, did I sleep?

396
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:43,819
Sleep?

397
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:47,081
With all that has happened, I who call elections,

398
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:48,799
like Adolfo Suarez.

399
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:52,069
Are they still awake?

400
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:54,780
What if we invite them for a drink?

401
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:56,050
And then what?

402
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:57,994
A ride on the bumper cars?

403
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,911
Sleep, Julian.

404
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:03,670
I can't sleep, Ricardo.

405
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,969
I can't stop thinking about Salome.

406
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:09,052
To all the time I've wasted.

407
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,555
To what you were saying.

408
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:12,004
About love.

409
00:30:12,005 --> 00:30:13,794
And on the fact that I have...

410
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:15,753
the handbrake is on.

411
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:19,797
To hell with it.

412
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:21,537
What are you doing, Julian?

413
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:23,321
You'll end up waking Valeria.

414
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:25,021
Let it be.

415
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,537
What are you doing, spying on them?

416
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:30,462
Get down there. And cover yourself. Your hair's showing, damn it.

417
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:31,733
What nonsense.

418
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:33,659
A life that we travel together halfway around the world,

419
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,560
and suddenly, one day, you look at it with different eyes.

420
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:39,365
Yes, because until yesterday you were telling him all sorts of things.

421
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,991
Do you see a future for it?

422
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:43,805
Truly.

423
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:45,247
What future do you want me to see for us?

424
00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:49,371
So sour and grumpy. With his rules and discipline. No.

425
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,810
I'm not sure.

426
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,157
I'll tell you something, Julia.

427
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:57,683
A relationship, as soon as you stop improvising,

428
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:00,261
It fades like a flower. That's how it is.

429
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:01,411
But did you hear it?

430
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:02,458
I don't improvise?

431
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:05,423
The one who kept us grouper fillet and escarole says so

432
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:07,250
from Athens to Valencia, damn it.

433
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,391
Pig...

434
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:09,892
And you?

435
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:11,687
- Me? - You.

436
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:14,499
- What? - There's someone you like, right?

437
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:18,375
This is madness.

438
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,703
After Philippe,

439
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:23,029
I thought it was all over for me.

440
00:31:23,723 --> 00:31:26,736
I don't know, it all happened so fast.

441
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:31,615
Per� s�.

442
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,125
There's someone I like.

443
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:36,653
Listen.

444
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:37,918
I know who he is.

445
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,409
- Ah s�? - Diamine.

446
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,366
- Who? - The captain.

447
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,992
But no, not the captain.

448
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:48,266
- Swear it's not the captain. - I swear it's not the captain.

449
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:51,749
It's Ulises.

450
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,005
Ricardo.

451
00:31:58,206 --> 00:31:59,582
They were talking about you, Ricardo.

452
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:01,671
- She fucking likes you. - Enough.

453
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:04,327
Enough, I don't want to hear anything else.

454
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:06,862
And let's go to sleep, the little girl will wake up.

455
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,498
Ricardo, listen.

456
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:12,988
On the other side, there is the woman I have always loved.

457
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,801
Always, for life.

458
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:17,214
And I don't want to let another twenty years go by,

459
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:20,572
to find the courage to knock on his door.

460
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,841
Ricardo, come on, please. Let's go.

461
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:27,688
- Okay. - Perfect!

462
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:54,767
You're shaking.

463
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,409
Are you cold?

464
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:01,710
No, it's anger.

465
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,684
I'm twenty years old and no one has the right to humiliate me like this.

466
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,557
Least of all my father.

467
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:14,960
If I sleep with Gamboa, or with the whole crew.

468
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,566
Get over it,

469
00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:22,977
because the ship is dad's house and you will spend the rest of your life here.

470
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:26,888
I don't feel like joking.

471
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,049
For a father...

472
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:36,520
No one person is the right one for their daughter.

473
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,525
It's written on the father's license.

474
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:50,442
Well, maybe he's not the right person,

475
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:55,355
But I have the right to bang my head against the wall by myself, right?

476
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
Right.

477
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:02,665
I don't know, maybe...

478
00:34:08,284 --> 00:34:10,288
if one day you bang your head against that wall...

479
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:15,296
and you need someone to put a band-aid on you,

480
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:19,574
call me.

481
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:23,502
I'll be there, okay?

482
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,034
Thank you.

483
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:51,794
Listen.

484
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:54,963
I hold the candle for ten minutes, then with the excuse of the little girl I go back.

485
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,233
Okay, okay.

486
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,131
Is it allowed?

487
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,532
- Good evening, Salome. - Good evening.

488
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:09,621
Ricardo and I were wondering if you guys would like to have a drink at the club?

489
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:11,051
Now?

490
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:15,651
Yes, now. Someone has to stand guard during curfew.

491
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,677
- So, at the club in ten minutes? - Yeah, fine.

492
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:21,721
- Yes? - Yes, come on.

493
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:24,076
- Good. - See you soon.

494
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:28,104
What do I wear?

495
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:31,399
I don't know if I can do it, I took two sleeping pills.

496
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:33,647
It's only half an hour, a beer, darling, you're so old.

497
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:37,232
- What should I wear? What should I wear? - But what if they came in pajamas and slippers?

498
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:39,455
- Are we going like this? - No, we're dressing up.

499
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,881
Like this? Without anything?

500
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:44,119
- Come on, wake up. - I really don't feel like it.

501
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:47,010
What do you say, put some hairspray in your hair and let's go.

502
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:17,696
Ainhoa.

503
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:22,150
The arm.

504
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:26,612
I'm going to shit myself. I have to go to the bathroom, I'm going to shit myself.

505
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,377
Ainhoa.

506
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,461
- What the hell! - I'm sorry.

507
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,088
Sorry. I'm going to shit myself.

508
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:14,308
What a beautiful fabric.

509
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:17,079
- There they are, my goodness. - They're dressed, see?

510
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:20,680
-Shall we change? -What's changing? We have to stay a moment.

511
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,167
HI.

512
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:28,854
- Good evening. - Hi.

513
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:31,572
So? Let's have a drink, shall we?

514
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,260
Julian!

515
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:45,016
- You're breaking the counter. Give it to me. - What?

516
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:48,619
- I'll check if I have a bottle opener in the kitchen. - Okay.

517
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:55,372
I... put on some music,

518
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:58,489
let's throw a party...

519
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:00,150
with bells and whistles!

520
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:09,887
HI.

521
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,496
- I have to, damn it. - Okay. What happened?

522
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,247
What happened?

523
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,473
- Ainhoa ​​has arrived in the room. - Yes?

524
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:21,421
- Yes, and we talked on the cot. - Good.

525
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:22,928
He hugged me,

526
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:25,425
to sleep. And he kissed me.

527
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:27,898
- Perfect. - On the cheek,

528
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:29,854
he gave me a kiss on the cheek.

529
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:32,958
You got it all wrong.

530
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:36,674
You just became his teddy bear.

531
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:39,245
-Didn't you tell me you were nice? -Yes...

532
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,560
but with friends, nice with friends, damn.

533
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,380
- Let's finish this. Let's finish this. - How do we finish this?

534
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:46,759
New plan...

535
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:49,598
- Go back inside and try it on with her, right now. - No.

536
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:52,439
Yes. Or tomorrow you will be the invisible man.

537
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:56,893
- Okay. - Come on.

538
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:59,401
Shit. I stepped in the puddle.

539
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:04,015
- Leave the puddle alone. - What disgusting things they are, damn it.

540
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:36,662
What are you doing here?

541
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:41,395
- If my father sees you here, he'll... - This is the only place...

542
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:43,686
when your father won't come looking for me.

543
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:47,315
I can?

544
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,322
- Bye bye.

545
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:34,498
By the time I find music, it will be out of fashion.

546
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,167
Do you want me to go look for something?

547
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
No.

548
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:49,028
It's just that I took some sleeping pills.

549
00:41:01,504 --> 00:41:04,241
I don't know why I'm asking, but...

550
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:11,655
How do you apologize to a daughter you've been an idiot to?

551
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:17,468
I'm going down as a father,

552
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:21,452
the ship sinks...

553
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:25,454
Julia.

554
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:28,626
Julia.

555
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,147
Excuse me.

556
00:41:53,623 --> 00:41:58,458
I'm sorry, but at night all the cabins are the same.

557
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,049
Put a blanket on, it's cold, okay?

558
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:31,943
- Ulises, where are you going? - Leave me alone.

559
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:34,299
- Wait, wait. What's up? - It's over, Piti.

560
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:39,058
If she wants to be with that idiot, okay, I'm nobody's spare tire.

561
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,671
Salome!

562
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:54,857
Salome!

563
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,605
- What's wrong? Is she drunk? - No. She fell asleep.

564
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:03,931
- And you? What do you do? - We couldn't agree on the CD and...

565
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,375
- speaking... I'll get dressed and come. - No. Leave it alone.

566
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,459
- No, what? - Go to hell, Julian.

567
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:10,606
- Ricardo. - Go to hell.

568
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:12,143
Ricardo, thank you.

569
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:07,726
Papi.

570
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:11,978
Is he sleeping with us?

571
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,382
Yes, darling. He sleeps with us.

572
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:17,180
Forever?

573
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:23,463
No, darling, just tonight because she's very tired. Come on,

574
00:44:23,488 --> 00:44:26,420
Keep sleeping, it's late. Come on.

575
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,817
Sleep, sleep. Wrap up warm.

576
00:44:29,142 --> 00:44:30,142
Cos�.

577
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:37,157
- Dad. - What's up?

578
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,884
Wouldn't you like him to sleep with us forever?

579
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:54,379
Yes I would like that, darling,

580
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:56,648
but let it remain a secret between me and you.

581
00:44:58,283 --> 00:45:00,206
Come on, keep sleeping.

582
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,575
Cover yourself well.

583
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:36,786
Or leave Ainhoa ​​alone...

584
00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:40,978
or one day you'll wake up in one of those sinking boxes.

585
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,273
Ah, what?

586
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:46,384
And how can you put me in a box if I break your legs?

587
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,599
I've already warned you once, this is the second.

588
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:00,353
There will not be a third.

589
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:08,722
I have some good news and some bad news for you.

590
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:14,111
The good thing is that, at the moment, I'm not interested in Ainhoa.

591
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,253
That bad one...

592
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,608
I often change my mind.

593
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:35,079
Very good.

594
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:46,626
Never threaten someone with a gun if you don't intend to use it.

595
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:20,201
And the hippos?

596
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:22,760
Leave it on the first table, Embolo.

597
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:53,324
- Embolus! - What the fuck is going on?

598
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,397
The ship is moving.

599
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,349
What's happening? Are you okay?

600
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,456
- Ricardo, what the fuck is going on? - The tide is rising and it's crushing us.

601
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,824
Tell everyone to leave the cabins.

602
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:16,647
- Attention, everyone out of the cabins! - Everyone out!

603
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:19,731
Everyone out of the cabins!

604
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:21,665
Join the club.

605
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,376
And hand out the life jackets, come on.

606
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,415
Quick!

607
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:33,683
Come to my cabin in two minutes.

608
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:47,833
Don't rush. Keep calm.

609
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:51,611
I want the sea state and wind speed, now!

610
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:55,076
The situation is this.

611
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,473
The ship is too stuck and the tide can't move us.

612
00:48:58,593 --> 00:49:02,439
If we don't free ourselves in twenty minutes, the high tide will break the hull in two.

613
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:07,905
And couldn't you have thought of that before, instead of drinking and fucking while the ship sinks?

614
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,142
Ricardo.

615
00:49:12,443 --> 00:49:13,443
Ricardo.

616
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:15,494
Well.

617
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:17,991
The ship is in the balance.

618
00:49:18,003 --> 00:49:20,846
The hold and these two compartments are watertight.

619
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:24,455
If we flood them, the weight will rock us and we may break free.

620
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,750
Ricardo, no, I think, I mean...

621
00:49:26,942 --> 00:49:29,683
the pressure of the water, entering, will carry away these two walls,

622
00:49:29,703 --> 00:49:32,207
- and the whole ship would break apart. - Those walls will hold.

623
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:35,181
Shall we have a drink to see if he's right this time?

624
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:39,598
What solutions does she have? What the fuck can she do?

625
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:42,572
- Please. Please. - Enough, enough, enough.

626
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,446
Let's calm down, okay?

627
00:49:51,952 --> 00:49:53,801
The captain is right.

628
00:49:54,148 --> 00:49:59,288
The ship is designed to stay afloat with both holds flooded.

629
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:00,807
Well.

630
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:05,125
We'll empty the compartments and open a crack in the hull, from the inside.

631
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:09,031
If we act quickly, we'll be able to free ourselves before it floods. Is that clear?

632
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:21,978
Come on, guys, come on, get some rhythm.

633
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:27,616
- Come on, guys, come on, come on. - Small boxes first, okay?

634
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:30,812
Come on, guys, come on.

635
00:50:32,994 --> 00:50:34,664
Be careful with the poles.

636
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:36,839
Watch out, up there!

637
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,496
- Everyone get out of here! Out! - Let's go on deck!

638
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:42,980
- Out! Quickly! - All hands on deck!

639
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:45,326
Captain, captain, wait, I can't move.

640
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:49,119
- Please, take it off me, please. - Relax, son, we'll get you out.

641
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:53,369
Wait, wait, please, please.

642
00:51:01,427 --> 00:51:02,507
That's it.

643
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:13,518
The door.

644
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:15,503
The door. Why doesn't it open?

645
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,068
Push!

646
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:21,119
Push!

647
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:25,518
- Push. Come on. - It won't open from here, I can't do it.

648
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:27,124
- Try again. - Why doesn't it open?

649
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:29,686
- Push hard! - It won't open!

650
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:38,549
Ricardo.

651
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,105
The hull.

652
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:43,339
I won't last more than five minutes.

653
00:51:43,711 --> 00:51:45,473
It's impossible.

654
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:47,859
Pap�.

655
00:51:49,562 --> 00:51:52,670
- Dad. Dad. - Ainhoa, let me do it for a moment.

656
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,656
Move away from the door. I'll try to open it.

657
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,044
Give it your all, Ulises.

658
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:02,049
Ulises, stop.

659
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,601
Julia.

660
00:52:05,842 --> 00:52:10,404
If you break the door, we'll flood the entire ship along with the hold.

661
00:52:13,637 --> 00:52:15,968
There would be no hope for anyone.

662
00:52:16,787 --> 00:52:17,832
Pap�.

663
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:21,854
They have a circular saw in there, tell them they can break the door.

664
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:23,495
What the hell do you want to do?

665
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:26,234
Ricardo...

666
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,392
Better three than forty, right?

667
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:32,763
- We have to act quickly. - What does three mean?

668
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:35,061
Captain, open the door, please.

669
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:40,333
Open the door! I'm twenty. There must be another solution, please.

670
00:52:40,372 --> 00:52:41,811
- Please. - Dad.

671
00:52:41,814 --> 00:52:45,293
- That's enough. - Calm down, damn it.

672
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:46,489
Stay calm.

673
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,565
Ulises says you have a circular saw and you can break the door.

674
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:51,601
Honey, if we do this...

675
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:53,344
we will all die.

676
00:52:53,348 --> 00:52:57,147
You won't die, we will survive on the lifeboats.

677
00:52:58,816 --> 00:53:02,788
You brought Valeria and me here to be together, remember?

678
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:07,720
So go out and keep your promise.

679
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:08,980
You go out.

680
00:53:10,138 --> 00:53:13,233
Open the door, damn it.

681
00:53:13,249 --> 00:53:15,403
I'm sorry, little sparrow, but...

682
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:18,147
we have no other choice.

683
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:21,383
Go away, come on.

684
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:23,319
No.

685
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,623
Let us out.

686
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:27,697
Please.

687
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:29,065
Please let us out.

688
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:31,507
- No. - Let us out, please.

689
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:32,697
Please.

690
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:33,918
Ainhoa.

691
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,173
Please.

692
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:37,649
Please.

693
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,017
Would you rather starve out there?

694
00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:52,932
We are talking about sacrificing the lives of three people.

695
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:55,150
The life of three people,

696
00:53:55,182 --> 00:53:56,529
or of all.

697
00:53:56,631 --> 00:54:00,604
- You heard the captain. - Just a moment. We heard.

698
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:02,575
But over there there is Piti, for example.

699
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:05,448
- What will become of him? - What would you like us to do?

700
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,496
Either his or ours.

701
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:09,521
Don't make us feel guilty.

702
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:12,163
It's our lives. But precisely for this reason...

703
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:15,387
- We have to think. - There's nothing we can do.

704
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:17,699
There's nothing we can do to save them.

705
00:54:17,715 --> 00:54:18,873
Julian.

706
00:54:19,274 --> 00:54:20,421
It's me.

707
00:54:20,576 --> 00:54:23,037
Please tell me something.

708
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,243
Please.

709
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:27,269
Julian, please.

710
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:29,958
I know you hear me, please.

711
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,943
You have to think clearly.

712
00:54:39,558 --> 00:54:44,105
If the wind continues to blow from the west, when it reaches 20 knots we hoist the sails.

713
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,698
Gentlemen, just a moment.

714
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:53,508
There is another way to get the ship out.

715
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:56,962
We can reverse it out.

716
00:54:57,512 --> 00:54:58,766
It's possible.

717
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:14,431
- Wait, wait. - What's up?

718
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:16,655
- We're safe. - What are you saying?

719
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:19,749
Oxygen, we have oxygen.

720
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:23,098
We can pierce the hull...

721
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:27,214
and pass us the respirator while we make a hole big enough to get out.

722
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:29,212
Right, Captain?

723
00:55:31,747 --> 00:55:33,623
That's right, isn't it?

724
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,770
I'm afraid not, son.

725
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:40,433
As soon as we open the crack...

726
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:45,088
we are left without electricity.

727
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:49,156
We won't have time to make a hole big enough.

728
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:52,290
What does he say?

729
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,620
I'm sorry, son.

730
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,517
Ainhoa.

731
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,729
Here I am, dad.

732
00:56:32,064 --> 00:56:33,226
Ainhoa...

733
00:56:35,262 --> 00:56:37,860
I wanted to apologize for last night.

734
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:41,961
Because I was an idiot.

735
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,036
For treating you like this.

736
00:56:47,468 --> 00:56:50,041
As if I were still a child.

737
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:58,938
It doesn't matter why...

738
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,460
because I want you to scold me a thousand times.

739
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:10,593
Because I will be wrong a thousand times.

740
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,598
And I want you to ground me.

741
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,978
And I want to argue and then apologize to you.

742
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:27,706
Now you will have to take care of your sister again.

743
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:30,413
Don't make her cry.

744
00:57:38,218 --> 00:57:40,531
Tell her I went to look for her mother.

745
00:57:42,509 --> 00:57:44,561
A million miles away.

746
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:51,516
He told you.

747
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:02,171
Tell her that...

748
00:58:03,123 --> 00:58:04,894
which will take a while.

749
00:58:08,413 --> 00:58:10,303
Don't wait for me.

750
00:58:12,346 --> 00:58:14,798
I'll wait for you.

751
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,517
Are you crazy?

752
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:33,449
With the wind at your head you will break the mainmast.

753
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,130
Or we'll turn upside down.

754
00:58:35,146 --> 00:58:38,665
It's the only way to save them without flooding the hold.

755
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:40,926
If we allow the captain...

756
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:43,499
and From the Block...

757
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:47,215
drown down there... we're all dead.

758
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:51,085
- We can run the ship without them. - No.

759
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:53,365
No, because tomorrow it could be you.

760
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,081
Either you, or you, or you stay down there.

761
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:00,749
If they die...

762
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:03,032
if we put a price on their lives...

763
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,028
our lives will no longer have any value.

764
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,459
Here we are, Julian.

765
00:59:32,713 --> 00:59:34,629
How much time has passed?

766
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,017
Eighteen years old?

767
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:39,145
Winds.

768
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:43,884
It was a great honor, Ricardo.

769
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:48,149
Damn.

770
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:01,293
- Julian. - Tell me.

771
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:07,408
How are you, son?

772
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:10,634
Scared to death.

773
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:14,492
If there is any chance of saving them, we must try.

774
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,733
Enough now!

775
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:24,883
- The decision has been made. - No!

776
01:00:28,432 --> 01:00:30,028
There are elections today.

777
01:00:30,143 --> 01:00:33,359
Here we decide democratically who is in charge.

778
01:00:39,787 --> 01:00:42,039
I'm running for office.

779
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:46,009
Gentlemen...

780
01:00:47,341 --> 01:00:49,026
Here's my vote.

781
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:19,676
My father said I would be nothing.

782
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:21,758
Instead...

783
01:01:22,143 --> 01:01:24,542
Thanks to me, humanity still has hope.

784
01:01:27,473 --> 01:01:28,813
Great, boy.

785
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:30,624
Big.

786
01:01:37,888 --> 01:01:39,262
Julian.

787
01:01:39,576 --> 01:01:41,562
Come on, tell me something.

788
01:01:41,566 --> 01:01:44,083
Tell me something, I know you hear me.

789
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,355
Please, Julian.

790
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:48,912
Please.

791
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:06,562
Julian, please.

792
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:09,229
Answers?

793
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:11,824
Or are you going to buy cigarettes this time?

794
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:50,012
Salome.

795
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:56,680
You once asked me...

796
01:02:57,382 --> 01:02:59,375
why I left that house.

797
01:02:59,439 --> 01:03:00,548
Memories?

798
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:02,186
S�.

799
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,404
It was because...

800
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:08,036
I was kidding myself.

801
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:09,726
You know it?

802
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:13,725
Because I never really loved her, because...

803
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,166
because I was in love with you.

804
01:03:22,117 --> 01:03:23,652
I love you.

805
01:03:26,923 --> 01:03:28,447
Me too.

806
01:03:33,046 --> 01:03:34,453
One more thing.

807
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,708
I have always loved you.

808
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,297
Over and out, baby.

809
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:49,611
No...

810
01:03:49,938 --> 01:03:51,181
no...

811
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:15,673
Force.

812
01:06:41,286 --> 01:06:43,215
The mayor is Ulises.

813
01:07:02,726 --> 01:07:04,760
- We have to hurry. - Come on.

814
01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:06,567
It does not work.

815
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:13,402
The captain is speaking. We're out of power in the hold. What's going on?

816
01:07:14,314 --> 01:07:16,731
Captain, this is the mayor of the ship speaking.

817
01:07:16,735 --> 01:07:19,502
My first mission will be to save you.

818
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:22,043
Hold on tight because we're going to do some dancing.

819
01:07:22,254 --> 01:07:23,893
Dai, Ulises, dai.

820
01:07:23,925 --> 01:07:26,723
It turns out he's really your son.

821
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,550
Dai, Ulises.

822
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:40,764
- Put it right. - All right.

823
01:07:49,127 --> 01:07:50,324
Dovecotes.

824
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:52,616
Tell me the wind speed.

825
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:55,357
Sixteen knots, and counting.

826
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:57,084
Let's set sail.

827
01:07:58,111 --> 01:07:59,349
Okay, wait.

828
01:07:59,397 --> 01:08:02,805
Wait before setting sail, we need more wind.

829
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:03,957
Received.

830
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:05,231
- Ramiro. - S�?

831
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:07,378
- Reverse, full speed. - All right.

832
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:10,341
Reverse gear.

833
01:08:49,263 --> 01:08:51,169
Doctor, is the breast free?

834
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:53,692
You can't see anything in the rearview mirrors.

835
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:00,906
Free.

836
01:09:01,436 --> 01:09:05,342
- Palomares, wind speed. - Twenty knots, and increasing.

837
01:09:05,343 --> 01:09:06,643
Okay, wait.

838
01:09:11,305 --> 01:09:12,997
Twenty-one knots.

839
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:19,749
Twenty-two.

840
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,630
Ventitr�.

841
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:34,186
- Twenty-four knots. - Keep going, guys.

842
01:09:35,622 --> 01:09:37,038
Twenty-five knots.

843
01:09:40,283 --> 01:09:43,047
- Twenty-six knots. - Now. Set sail.

844
01:09:43,064 --> 01:09:44,304
Now.

845
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:04,474
If the ship doesn't leave immediately, we will sink.

846
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:07,419
- Stop the engines. - No, don't stop the engines.

847
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:12,019
You're doing well, guys.

848
01:10:18,262 --> 01:10:20,467
Is this the best you can do?

849
01:10:21,839 --> 01:10:24,476
Ulises, good God, what are you waiting for?

850
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:28,404
Stop the engines, Ulises.

851
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,609
Force...

852
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:31,600
What are you waiting for?

853
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,422
I'm waiting for this.

854
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:48,193
Man of little faith.

855
01:10:59,295 --> 01:11:00,835
We got out of trouble.

856
01:11:04,502 --> 01:11:06,800
- We're floating. - We're sailing.

857
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,441
We are sailing.

858
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:10,614
We are safe.

859
01:11:23,339 --> 01:11:24,905
- We're safe. - Great, boy.

860
01:11:25,006 --> 01:11:26,714
We are safe.

861
01:11:51,696 --> 01:11:53,185
Where the fuck are we?

862
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:55,824
- Why doesn't the compass point north? - I don't know.

863
01:11:55,828 --> 01:11:59,184
Perhaps we are in an area of ​​extreme magnetic virulence.

864
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,208
Guard.

865
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:05,536
If that man is there, there must be other ships, right?

866
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:08,992
Someone stole the tranquilizers.

867
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:11,552
Who the fuck would do something like that?

868
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,735
I remind you that a few days ago he was about to kill your father.

869
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:20,207
I'm mad at you because you killed a boy, you son of a bitch.

870
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:21,762
Don't look at me...

871
01:12:22,063 --> 01:12:24,014
and don't talk to me.

872
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:26,712
"The island is no longer there." "There is no land."

873
01:12:26,744 --> 01:12:28,608
"Australia is not there."

874
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:30,007
You're crazy.

875
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:31,131
Stop.

876
01:12:31,437 --> 01:12:32,941
Leave me.

877
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:36,220
My dad likes someone on the ship too.

878
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,820
What's going on, Julia? Why is it night at 9:15 in the morning?

879
01:12:41,836 --> 01:12:45,275
- The sun? - Without land we can live, but...

880
01:12:45,308 --> 01:12:46,567
Without the sun?

881
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:49,695
