1
00:00:01,265 --> 00:00:04,585
-It is possible that an accident during start-up...

2
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:08,266
...of the particle accelerator has had consequences...

3
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:10,986
...incalculable. If so, then surely,

4
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:14,987
the Earth will be different. -There it is.

5
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:18,628
-Maybe we're not the only ones who survived the storm.

6
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,469
What is this, Ricardo? - A video camera.

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,109
-Over there, in the background. -But who was recording this?

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,910
-And why didn't they respond to our signals? And where did they go?

9
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:35,831
-The device is a kind of transponder,

10
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:39,672
It is used to send a signal indicating our position.

11
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:42,153
- Are you sending a signal? To whom?

12
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:44,673
-I don't know. -It's not just for broadcasting...

13
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:48,314
...long-distance signals, but also to receive them.

14
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,555
What do you want me to do now? - Forget what you did.

15
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:54,675
Whatever happens, not a single word to the captain.

16
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:56,876
-Do you want to be my wife? -Yes.

17
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:01,396
-Well, I now pronounce us husband and wife.

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,918
What is the cancer? - It's prostate cancer,

19
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,718
But they're just markers. I can only give you this.

20
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,839
-Do me a favor, doctor? Don't tell anyone.

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,000
-Constantly deceiving yourself to convince yourself that you're not...

22
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,401
...in love, it must be exhausting, right?

23
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:32,643
...straight to the bottom.

24
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:36,843
-I'm sure you don't give a shit about Ainhoa, you're fighting for something else.

25
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:41,964
-Last warning, I'm nobody to you.

26
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,645
You're right about us not knowing each other,

27
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:50,126
Because no one lets me. - You're a fucking murderer...

28
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,247
...and you won't get out of here. -Hey!

29
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:56,088
-A life raft is missing. -Gamboa!

30
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:59,088
Who are you? - Why don't you ask Julia?

31
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,609
-What does Julia have to do with all this?

32
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,969
-Do you know anything about her, about her life, about who she is?

33
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,850
-What was that?

34
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:13,571
-Where's Gamboa? -We only found Ulises.

35
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:16,772
-It can't be. -What will happen to Julia?

36
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:20,652
-Whatever happens, it won't be your fault, it will be mine.

37
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:24,173
-We demand that Ulises be tried for the murder of Gamboa.

38
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:28,134
-Sorry, I made a mistake. -Yes.

39
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:30,535
-Captain, we've found Gamboa.

40
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:36,656
(Sound) (JOKE) -It's a cell phone.

41
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,616
-It is impossible for the raft to overtake the boat,

42
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:42,817
I need to talk to him. -No, he's my patient, Captain.

43
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,858
-You can go, but if you want to be by my side,

44
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:50,138
You'll have to play by my rules. I told you I wouldn't lie to you, Ramiro,

45
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,619
but there are things I can't tell you.

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,740
-What's that? -It's been on for three hours...

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,900
...on a loop, it might be coming from the ship we're heading towards.

48
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:02,141
-Ainhoa ​​is now with Ulises. -Next time,

49
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,222
I will kill him and your father; and, of course, your sister.

50
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:10,062
"Julia's cheating on us, I don't like it." "What are you doing here?"

51
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:13,863
Why did you come back? - Don't ask what you already know, Julia.

52
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:17,344
Do your duty. -There are more signs,

53
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:20,585
They are bombarding the ship with signals.

54
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,905
(Sign) Yes, tell me.

55
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:28,986
-Ulises, I was wrong. Gamboa's back and...

56
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:37,508
I don't love you, Ulysses, I don't love you. -Captain, everyone,

57
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,749
Go up to the bridge, they're calling us on the phone.

58
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,990
They're calling us! -Captain.

59
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:50,511
(Interferences)

60
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:53,351
Captain!

61
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:56,552
Captain!

62
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:07,074
Captain, are you there? Can you hear me? - I can hear you.

63
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:11,235
-Thank God, Captain. This is Commander Hopkins speaking.

64
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:15,956
We need to be rescued, we have four hours left to live.

65
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:21,157
-We'll be there as soon as possible, give us your position.

66
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:24,638
-Our position won't be of much use to them, Captain,

67
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:29,158
We are 367 km from your ship, on its vertical axis.

68
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,880
-Above.

69
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:43,561
-We are Commander Hopkins, Engineer Davis,

70
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:48,922
and Dr. Kolivanov. We're speaking to you from the space station...

71
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:54,123
...international. -What are you telling us? Are you astronauts?

72
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:02,686
-Fleet.

73
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:22,089
"The first day of school, after the holidays,

74
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,330
you met your friends again.

75
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:30,211
Some had grown their hair, others had lost it...

76
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:35,492
...some teeth, and others were higher than before the summer.

77
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:48,094
But besides your friends, there were always new kids...

78
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:53,615
...who came from other schools. At first, you didn't recognize them...

79
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:57,696
...you're welcome, but after playing with them at recess,

80
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:00,937
They were your friends just like the others."

81
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:04,698
-How long have you been up there? -Haven't you been able to see anything?

82
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,059
-Are there more people alive?

83
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,779
-Do you see Earth? -Didn't even Houston answer?

84
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,740
-Bubble, go outside. "Because as my mom used to say,

85
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,301
the important thing is to make new friends,

86
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:23,822
wherever they come from."

87
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,304
-It hurts a little, right?

88
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:44,506
-It's healthy. -I'm not talking about exercise,

89
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:48,947
I'm talking about the fact that you're no longer with Ulysses, that he left you.

90
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:56,628
Julia, I'm with you, on your team. Now you see me happy...

91
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,669
...because I'm with Julian, but if we play how many times...

92
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,830
...they've planted more on you, you can't beat me.

93
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:09,591
-We are not alone! We are not alone!

94
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:14,232
The signals are on TV, they were spacemen.

95
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:17,073
The captain talks to them.

96
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:23,874
You have to prepare a fish soup or a crab cream for them.

97
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,955
Because in space the food is very bad.

98
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:39,957
What's up? Don't you want the astronauts to come?

99
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,238
-What kind of cloud are those?

100
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:08,083
-Let's see, Commander. -We all have questions,

101
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:11,363
But let's take it one step at a time. -If we all speak at once,

102
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:14,404
we're not going to understand each other, okay?

103
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,005
-Captain, we need more information.

104
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:24,006
-Tell us, Commander. -We're in a critical situation.

105
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:28,807
The Zvezda and three life support modules have left...

106
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:33,208
...to generate oxygen, we have an evacuation vessel.

107
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:36,809
In three hours and four minutes we will undock,

108
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,289
and in 45 minutes we will land five miles from your position.

109
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,410
-Let's see, Commander. We're sailors.

110
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:50,451
We're not used to your jargon. Please be clearer.

111
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:54,972
-It's simple, when we fall into the sea, or we are rescued...

112
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:59,093
...in 30 minutes or we'll sink.

113
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,855
-I give you my word that we will rescue him.

114
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:17,616
-Thank you. You don't know what this is like. We had lost hope.

115
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:21,938
We thought we were dead. (SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN)

116
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,378
-Commander, do you see land? We know of an island,

117
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:28,219
of about 3,000 hectares, south of the Azores,

118
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,540
but we do not know their exact situation.

119
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,780
-The display system was managed from Houston and,

120
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:37,501
To see land with the naked eye, it should have a surface...

121
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,822
...the size of Nebraska.

122
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:49,543
Captain, can we talk?

123
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,784
Alone. -Yes, of course.

124
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:58,105
-Well, gentlemen, you heard him. Everyone back to work. Let's go!

125
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:01,946
Let's see, they are the first human beings we have encountered.

126
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,386
Damn! That's why no. I'll tell you what they'll do.

127
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:09,467
Ramiro, rearrange a cabin. The others take care of it...

128
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,668
...to organize a party all together, okay?

129
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,589
But I want a big party. Banners, garlands!

130
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,709
Whatever it takes. As if there were no tomorrow.

131
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,310
Let these people not think that we don't know how to receive visitors!

132
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,751
Gamboa, this is for you too. Piti, you're supposed to be...

133
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,431
...the professional at this. -Yes, man!

134
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:31,592
-Well, I want to see it. -Let's go, officer, let's go.

135
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,432
-A space capsule falling from the sky and a training ship...

136
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:39,033
...lost and out of fuel. I wouldn't bother preparing...

137
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:41,194
...a cabin for those guys.

138
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:44,034
I don't think it will turn out well, what a shame.

139
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:48,515
Ramiro, I want you at the winery in 30 minutes.

140
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:51,956
I need you to connect me to the transponder.

141
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:56,757
-Yeah. And I need answers. -No, you need answers.

142
00:10:56,758 --> 00:10:59,678
And how many answers do you need?

143
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:03,118
Do three seem enough to you?

144
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,919
Three questions, three answers. Not one more.

145
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,320
So choose wisely. - Are you serious?

146
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:17,601
-Strange way to waste the first one. Answer:

147
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:23,082
Yes, I'm serious. I was joking.

148
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,803
First question.

149
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:33,484
-Is Pilar dead?

150
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:37,605
I need to know.

151
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:44,486
-Dead and buried under tons of tectonic mass and millions...

152
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:47,887
...of cubic liters of water.

153
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:51,008
I thought you were smarter, Ramiro.

154
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,649
Think better about the second one.

155
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,850
30 minutes and in wineries.

156
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:11,572
-We must put the boat hooks in the bow!

157
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,173
Let's go!

158
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:17,933
And set the nets!

159
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:21,174
Let's go fishing for spacemen!

160
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:31,736
Come on, we need more networks! Come on, all the ones there are! Let's go!

161
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,457
-Let's go see in the cellar, let's go.

162
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:46,779
-Just a second, please. Ainhoa, please give me a second.

163
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:58,141
75 meters in length and four decks give much more...

164
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:01,102
...than it seems.

165
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:05,343
If we follow the quadrants to the letter, we won't see each other...

166
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,504
...the faces here.

167
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:13,904
I'll shower from eight thirty to a quarter to nine,

168
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:16,705
you from nine fifteen to nine thirty.

169
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:20,026
Lunch, dinner, and breakfast shifts: me first...

170
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,187
...and you're third. -Please...

171
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:26,587
-Outings on deck. You, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

172
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:29,908
Me, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and alternate Sundays.

173
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:34,629
Regarding homework, I'll talk to my father about it...

174
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:37,309
...get us something.

175
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,790
Take.

176
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:49,511
Now that I think about it, I think these quadrants won't be necessary.

177
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,674
Do you know why?

178
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,475
-No.

179
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:10,236
-Because no one wakes up in the morning loving someone...

180
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:13,517
...and stops loving him at nap time.

181
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:19,278
I was down there for 18 minutes, just 18.

182
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,279
Nobody stops loving someone in 18 minutes Ainhoa.

183
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
I don't care what you tell me,

184
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,601
I know you still love me.

185
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:57,966
(Beep) - Do you see us now, Commander?

186
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:00,366
-No.

187
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,847
-He's my trusted man. Whatever he can tell me,

188
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:07,808
You can tell him about it. -Two things.

189
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:13,008
Four days after the cataclysm, between 16:03 and 16:19,

190
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,649
Washington time, we received six satellite broadcasts.

191
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,730
(SPEAKS IN ENGLISH) -One of them is his ship.

192
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:24,931
-That's when the warehouse's transponder was activated.

193
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:29,532
But if there were five more signals, could there be another five ships?

194
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:33,173
-We don't know if they were ships. We sent them the coordinates.

195
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:37,213
(SPEAKS IN ENGLISH) Since that day, we have issued...

196
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:42,174
...SOS signals and the film to attract attention.

197
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:46,015
We have only managed to contact you.

198
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:48,656
-Are you okay? -Yes, fine.

199
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,017
"Are you all right, Captain?" "Yes. And the second thing that..."

200
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:56,057
...you wanted to tell us? - A stormy mass with clouds...

201
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:59,218
...of vertical development and electric charge...

202
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,059
...approaching you. Clouds over 100 knots...

203
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:08,579
...and winds of 170 km/h. The vortex is 47 miles away...

204
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:11,741
...from his position, but he moves forward quickly.

205
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:14,981
They'll have it on them within four hours.

206
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:19,702
-Right at the time of the rescue. -We can't delay the evacuation.

207
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:24,023
I know what I'm asking for is suicide, but my obligation is...

208
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:27,424
...try to save the lives of my men.

209
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:31,585
I will understand any decision you make.

210
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:35,825
We will get back to you in two hours.

211
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,866
-Okay, Commander.

212
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:53,509
-Cuckoo! -Tomato juice?

213
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,230
-Almost a Bloody Mary. The Salomé Method for heartbreak. Drink.

214
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,470
"Salomé, I don't need to get drunk. This isn't the first time I've been dumped."

215
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:05,151
-You're lying. They've never let you go in your life. It's written all over you...

216
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,792
...in the freckle above your eyebrow.

217
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,993
On the other hand, I have seven boyfriends and all seven have left me.

218
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,433
You, baby.

219
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:14,714
-Come on.

220
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:18,394
How delicious, please!

221
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:23,435
Where did you learn to do it? - Alejandro Medino, 2001-2003.

222
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,916
Hairdresser, an artist with scissors and a cocktail shaker.

223
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:30,596
-And what happened? -Barbara, shampoo saleswoman.

224
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:35,237
Bust: 105; operated. A bitch. - Did he cheat on you?

225
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:39,238
-Right down to the stem. But once that bitch came to get her hair cut,

226
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,719
I traded his shampoo for glue. Didn't you want to be together?

227
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,120
Come on, inseparable ones. Drink. - What?

228
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,600
-Grandma.

229
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,001
-The difference is that the one who took my boyfriend away from me...

230
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:56,642
...she's not a shampoo commercial, she's the captain's daughter.

231
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:58,123
And she's no bitch, she's a sweetheart.

232
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:02,204
-And that doesn't help, right?

233
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:08,844
-Salomé, I'm even more devastated after two weeks...

234
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:12,045
...what I've been through with Ulysses, for eight years...

235
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:15,726
...that I've been with Philipe. I feel like a really bad person.

236
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,926
-At the end of the world everything is magnified more.

237
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:22,447
One day here is more than a year ago.

238
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,168
Everything hurts more, that's why you feel worse. Drink.

239
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,450
I want you to think positively and brighten up that face,

240
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,851
Because one nail drives out another. And astronauts...

241
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:43,331
...they're going to come looking for a party. Yes, because as far as I know,

242
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,132
Up there, there are no sluts. (THEY LAUGH)

243
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:47,892
Come on, cheers.

244
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:10,737
-I've seen you before with Ulysses.

245
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,898
-I haven't spoken to him, really.

246
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,539
I haven't even looked at him.

247
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:30,981
-It was a lie, I hadn't seen you;

248
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,902
but whenever you do, I'll end up knowing.

249
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:39,862
And I hope you are clear about the terms of our contract.

250
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:46,864
If you're with Ulysses, I'll kill him, your father, and your sister.

251
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:52,426
Himself.

252
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,070
-Come on, get it all out, quick.

253
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,832
-25 years of logbooks. Never the Estrella...

254
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:29,113
...has faced a cyclone of this nature.

255
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:31,793
-We survived the cataclysm storm.

256
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:36,194
-That storm only grazed us. The cyclone will hit us full on.

257
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,035
Ricardo, there's no land. The cyclones are no longer losing strength;

258
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:42,516
On the contrary, they become stronger and stronger.

259
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:46,076
And we're without an engine. Without propulsion, we'll sink.

260
00:20:55,719 --> 00:21:00,639
Under normal circumstances I would give both legs for astronauts,

261
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,160
but not the 42 lives on board.

262
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,960
-I gave them my word that we would save them.

263
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,041
-You've also given your word to the crew...

264
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:14,162
...that you'd keep them alive. How many words does a captain have?

265
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:16,882
-Always one more than a first officer.

266
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:20,083
We're not going to move from the coordinates, is that clear?

267
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:24,684
Order everyone to put on their vests.

268
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:35,286
Don't you hear me? I gave you an order, officer.

269
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:40,367
Stand at attention and obey my order.

270
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:43,208
Square up!

271
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,853
-Come on, guys. How's it going? -Is it straight?

272
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:14,734
-A little more to the left. -It has to look really nice.

273
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,815
-Vilma, Vilma!

274
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,975
I'm an idiot.

275
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:27,056
I know, an idiot capable of risking the paternity of your child...

276
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:32,097
...the dice, but I also know that when I'm around you...

277
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:37,619
I am better.

278
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:48,461
I told you I love you...

279
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:53,062
...and you didn't say anything, Vilma.

280
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,263
The question is simple:

281
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,863
(Noise) Do you love me?

282
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,265
-Don't know.

283
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:23,628
-This one, there it is. Come on. Start with your homework.

284
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:28,509
-What is mouse in English? -Mouse.

285
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,750
Like Mickey Mouse on TV. It's written like this:

286
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:38,791
M-O-U-S-E.

287
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:45,672
-If the TV owners are in heaven,

288
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,473
Are they... dead?

289
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:54,834
-No, honey, no. No one's dead here.

290
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:59,075
They are in a spaceship, which is...

291
00:24:01,196 --> 00:24:04,196
It's like a hotel, but it's up in the sky.

292
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:08,597
-No, they're in a rocket. Like this.

293
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:11,878
And it is higher than the clouds.

294
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:16,318
They are very far away. -If they are in heaven,

295
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,200
maybe they've seen mom.

296
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:30,241
-I don't know, honey. Honestly, I don't think so.

297
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:35,042
Imagine there are a lot of people in heaven. It would be a coincidence, wouldn't it?

298
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,963
-Yes, that's true. There are many people in heaven.

299
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:43,044
There are more people than on the Gran Vía during the parade...

300
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:47,325
...of the Three Wise Men. -Look, let's make a deal.

301
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:50,166
You do your homework, and as soon as I speak...

302
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:53,526
...with the astronauts I ask them if they've seen Mom.

303
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,207
Okay? Come on.

304
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:06,128
(COMPLAINS) - It hurts. The same thing happened to me here.

305
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,090
12 stitches. I wanted to take the appendix home,

306
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:18,171
But the doctors wouldn't let me. They were unfriendly.

307
00:25:27,014 --> 00:25:31,294
I have seen these points before.

308
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:37,695
I don't know where, but I've seen them.

309
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,539
-Is it connected? -Yes.

310
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,380
And now the second question: why us?

311
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:08,941
Why the hell are we alive? Is it for a reason or is it just a coincidence?

312
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:12,102
-Are you asking me if the crew...

313
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:18,103
...of the North Star we are a kind of chosen ones?

314
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:25,784
The answer is yes, we are chosen.

315
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:28,665
Almost everyone.

316
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:36,667
Now I need you to leave me alone.

317
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,668
-Very good.

318
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,406
-I love you.

319
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:41,732
-Julia, these guys have been in space for 170 days,

320
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:44,933
that are horny, that come with accumulated love.

321
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,654
(LAUGHS) - What? - As soon as you pout...

322
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:51,094
...to the commander, puts you into orbit before you tell him:

323
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:52,935
"My name is Ju...". (RÍE)

324
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:57,095
-We need to put on our vests. Is that alcohol?

325
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,696
-No no.

326
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,896
-Oh, no? -No.

327
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:05,297
-Can I join you? -This is a very exclusive club.

328
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:07,898
-Yes? -There's only one way in.

329
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:11,098
-Let's see, how? -When was the last time...

330
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,499
...that they rejected you like a stinker?

331
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,260
-Seven minutes, 43 seconds ago. -Fuck.

332
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:22,381
-I've declared my love to Vilma, she told me she doesn't know.

333
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:25,461
-Well, but then he might go and say yes,

334
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:28,822
So he's not in the club. -But what's he going to say?

335
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:31,422
That's the preamble to the ass kicking.

336
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:34,263
Now, that's what I get for renouncing my creed.

337
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:37,704
First, never be friends with an aunt, ever.

338
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:41,344
Second, if when you are with her you do not see the dust clearly,

339
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:44,185
stop listening to her or you might get attached to her.

340
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:47,026
And third, if you get attached to him, move to another city.

341
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:49,586
(LAUGHS) I have fallen with Vilma,

342
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:53,827
and look, it doesn't even turn me on, but here, I'm completely in love,

343
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:59,227
You know? Up to my neck. Turned into an asshole,

344
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:02,949
the father of all assholes. - You're not an asshole, Piti.

345
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:05,869
(IRONIC) -No, I'm not. -You're not an asshole.

346
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,350
-On the contrary, you're no longer an asshole.

347
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:13,631
I'm going to get more juice, because it seems to me...

348
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:16,632
...that the afternoon is going to be very long.

349
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:35,516
-Captain!

350
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,796
-Dime.

351
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:45,917
-I'm crazy about your daughter.

352
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,558
I'm screwed.

353
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,199
I love her, and she loves me.

354
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,840
Well, yesterday he loved me, today he says no.

355
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:03,521
I don't know what to do, I'm going crazy.

356
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,602
-Ulises, that's something between you and Ainhoa.

357
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:09,802
-Just a second, Captain, please. Give me a second.

358
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:17,003
I told her I didn't believe her, but I'm scared.

359
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:21,205
I'm afraid it's true.

360
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:26,046
You don't know anything, do you?

361
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,206
-Ulises,

362
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:34,007
People change their minds, you should know that better than anyone.

363
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:39,168
The doctor, do you remember?

364
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:45,169
One day you loved her and the next you didn't,

365
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,490
and now he walks like a zombie,

366
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,971
shattered.

367
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,058
(Thunder)

368
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,699
-Captain?

369
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,179
Captain!

370
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,780
Captain, what's wrong? Help! Help!

371
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,020
Please, I need help! -Ricardo! Ricardo!

372
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:44,341
No, Ricar...! -Doctor.

373
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:48,502
-Julia! Julia! -Captain!

374
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:01,625
-You have decided to return to the nest.

375
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:11,787
-Why Ulysses? Why him?

376
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:16,028
Tell me what I have to do!

377
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:19,508
I'm going to do it, whatever it is, it doesn't matter.

378
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:24,189
But let me be with him.

379
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,750
I love him.

380
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:31,631
-How much? How much do you love him?

381
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:40,313
Do you love him enough to take his life...

382
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:44,113
...to the man who is an obstacle to you being with him?

383
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:47,994
Do you love him enough to kill me?

384
00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:55,156
-Yes.

385
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:59,557
-Miriam, a Bisbal fan, left me because she said...

386
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:02,157
...that we were going too slow for her.

387
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:04,718
(THEY LAUGH)

388
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:07,278
-Do you want a resume? -Yes.

389
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:10,839
-José Vicente, professor of Applied Physics,

390
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,039
elevator panic. (LAUGHS)

391
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:21,281
He left me because it turns out I reminded him of his daughter,

392
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:23,682
because I was the same age as her.

393
00:34:23,722 --> 00:34:25,722
(THEY LAUGH) -Wait.

394
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:29,282
Inés, ugly, ugly... -Oh, poor thing.

395
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:32,003
-She left me for a guy who was missing an eye.

396
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:33,804
(LAUGHS) I swear.

397
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:37,524
-For Inés. -For Inés... and her boyfriend.

398
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:51,487
-Philipe. College sweethearts.

399
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:54,728
I always had to strain the orange juice...

400
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,528
...because he hated pulp.

401
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:01,609
He didn't leave me.

402
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,290
-Vilma.

403
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:12,051
We met her pregnant and I with a piece of gum on my forehead.

404
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:16,532
He's a thousand times better than any girl I've ever met. 1,000 times better.

405
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:19,693
He doesn't love me.

406
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:23,173
-¡Bah, bah!

407
00:35:33,856 --> 00:35:35,616
-Julia, the captain.

408
00:35:35,657 --> 00:35:38,497
The appendix area is as hard as a rock.

409
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,297
You have to operate on him. -What?

410
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,058
-Get in the shower. Come on, get in the shower.

411
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:45,858
-The appendix. -Yes, appendicitis. Come on, honey.

412
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:47,019
To the shower.

413
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,860
-If you love him so much, you just have to shoot...

414
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:01,181
...and then you throw the lamp on the floor,

415
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,102
you rip your shirt,

416
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:09,023
you cut your lip with the box cutter...

417
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,263
...and you say I tried to force myself on you.

418
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,184
You're the captain's daughter and I'm the bad boy on the ship.

419
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:19,385
It's impossible for them not to believe you.

420
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:25,266
If you love Ulysses so much, if you want to be with him so much,

421
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:31,867
a slight movement of your index finger and you'll get it.

422
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:36,388
You just have to shoot.

423
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:56,792
(CRIES)

424
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,679
-From the Block. -Yes.

425
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:32,119
-Clouds are like glitter. -Yeah.

426
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,560
-They seem to have little lights. "-Julian, can you hear me?"

427
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,202
-Yes, Salome, tell me.

428
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:43,882
-Listen carefully: Julia is going to operate on Ricardo.

429
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:47,083
-What? -Appendicitis.

430
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:48,243
-Fuck!

431
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:51,443
-But the worst of all is that he has never operated on anyone;

432
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:53,524
neither appendicitis nor anything.

433
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:56,205
Are you listening to me, Julian? - Yes, I can hear you.

434
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:59,685
-You are in command of the Star.

435
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,367
For God's sake!

436
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:12,768
(Coup)

437
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:22,729
-It's a horse mackerel. -Yes, I can see it.

438
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,850
(Coup)

439
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:30,491
What's that? What the fuck...?

440
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:34,012
(Blows)

441
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:42,614
But what's this about? Come on.

442
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:48,095
-What is that? -I don't know.

443
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:51,216
-It's raining horse mackerel.

444
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:55,697
It's because of the cyclone,

445
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:59,177
that takes sea water and spits it out hundreds of kilometers.

446
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:01,698
-The mother who gave birth to him.

447
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,620
-What's that?

448
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:21,262
Attention, new order. We hoist the gaff.

449
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,582
We turned 60 degrees to port.

450
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:27,223
It's an order, I repeat. -Very well, De la Cuadra.

451
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:33,024
-Sorry for the astronauts, but we're leaving. Let's go.

452
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:35,305
-Let's go.

453
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:58,629
(Radio in English)

454
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,230
(Beeps)

455
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:07,471
-What happened? -Calm down.

456
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:10,912
-What time is it? The commander and his crew...

457
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:14,512
-He's just been fainting. You have a serious case of appendicitis.

458
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:17,073
Julia is going to operate on you. Tell the doctor.

459
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,634
-We have a cyclone approaching the ship...

460
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:22,034
...and some men to rescue.

461
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:24,235
Tell Julia to operate on me later.

462
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:27,755
-Don't worry, Julian is in charge of the Estrella.

463
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:30,236
-But what the fuck...?

464
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:31,996
We are moving.

465
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:34,557
We are moving away from the coordinates.

466
00:40:37,558 --> 00:40:40,598
-"An incision is made on the right side of the abdomen...

...leaving the blind man uncovered."

468
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:47,119
Julia, I'm sorry. I don't know why I kissed you.

469
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,240
-I had to.

470
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,400
I have to perform an operation for which I am not qualified...

471
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:56,361
...in the middle of a storm and incredibly drunk.

472
00:40:57,762 --> 00:40:58,762
Lee.

473
00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:03,842
-"The appendix is ​​removed, clamped, and tied at the base...

474
00:41:03,883 --> 00:41:08,443
...and it cuts off." That must be why everything here is magnified.

475
00:41:08,484 --> 00:41:11,124
You have created a complicity,

476
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:14,004
I thought it was very good and...

477
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:17,565
-Piti, protocol, please. Forget the kiss.

478
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:22,326
-"The stump is sewn, the cecum is introduced and the wound is saturated."

479
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:27,367
I don't need everything to be magnified to see...

480
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:29,488
...that you're hot, Julia.

481
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,408
You are good magnified,

482
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:34,169
without magnifying and in all ways, Julia.

483
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:35,289
Leo.

484
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,929
(Whistle)

485
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,450
-Ricardo, please don't take off the IV. Ricardo!

486
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,690
Please...

487
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:46,771
-"The suture that comes out can be made of loose stitches,

488
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:48,892
continuous or staples".

489
00:41:48,932 --> 00:41:52,652
-Give me codeine so I can handle the pain. I can't have surgery.

490
00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:55,253
I have to stop us from leaving, Salome.

491
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:58,053
-I'm not going to give you anything. -Give me codeine!

492
00:41:58,094 --> 00:41:59,614
-Julia, are you okay?

493
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:03,294
Maybe you'd do well to eat something, some sautéed seaweed,

494
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:06,735
something to help you... Julia, are you okay?

495
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,776
-No. -No what?

496
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:12,776
-Look at you. You're going to kill yourself.

497
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,900
-Step aside, Salome.

498
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:41,702
-It would be handy to have a guide like this,

499
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:46,423
to tell you point by point how not to screw up in a relationship.

500
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,344
I would have done better with Vilma.

501
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:53,265
-Take it easy with Vilma.

502
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,905
I know your profile:

503
00:42:56,786 --> 00:43:01,186
intelligent, rebellious, cunning.

504
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,027
If you overwhelm her, she runs away.

505
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:08,228
Like Ulysses.

506
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:14,509
Maybe if I hadn't pressured him...

507
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:23,951
Eh... Vale.

508
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,672
-Julia, I'll tell you something. -What?

509
00:43:27,712 --> 00:43:30,832
-Everyone on this ship knew that Ulysses...

510
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:33,193
...he was in love with Ainhoa.

511
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:38,193
Except two people: you and him.

512
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:43,275
-Doctor.

513
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:46,315
The captain has regained consciousness.

514
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,440
(VIDEO) "Captain. Captain."

515
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:13,321
-Hello, Mr. Astronaut. I'm doing my homework.

516
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:16,521
Do you know how to say "bunny" in English?

517
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:19,002
-If you say "rabbit."

518
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:24,603
Who are you, "little girl"?

519
00:44:25,604 --> 00:44:29,804
-Valeria. My dad is the captain of everyone.

520
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:36,325
Is it true that you are in heaven and that you see everything?

521
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:38,446
-Absolutely everything.

522
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,207
-Do you see my mom? She went to heaven a few months ago.

523
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:50,568
She's blonde like me, with hair here and very pretty.

524
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:53,489
Do you see her?

525
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,970
-The truth is that today everything is full of clouds.

526
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:02,531
But I will look for her.

527
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:09,532
-When you see her, tell her that I always finish my food,

528
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:13,573
that I lost a tooth and that I wet the bed,

529
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:16,453
But only for one day. And Dad likes it...

530
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:20,294
...a very pretty girl, but not as pretty as her.

531
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:25,815
-I'll tell her. -And that I miss her.

532
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,137
-Come with me!

533
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:36,177
I want the biggest one with a curl.

534
00:45:36,218 --> 00:45:40,298
Tighten the foremast well to raise the lower topsail.

535
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:42,499
Okay? Let's go!

536
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,981
-Julian!

537
00:45:57,742 --> 00:46:01,182
What the fuck are you doing? - Saving your own skin and everyone else's.

538
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:03,783
The wind doesn't push us enough,

539
00:46:03,824 --> 00:46:05,824
we hoisted the mizzenmast fully.

540
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:09,184
-Give a new order right now, turn the Star around.

541
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:12,425
-You don't realize. It's raining fish, Ricardo.

542
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:16,425
This isn't a normal cyclone. If we don't leave, it'll swallow us up.

543
00:46:16,466 --> 00:46:19,826
-I told you to turn the ship around.

544
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:22,467
-No, it would be suicide.

545
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:26,027
And there are too many people on this boat that I love.

546
00:46:26,068 --> 00:46:29,348
If you have forgotten who you want on board,

547
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:32,589
I feel sorry for you, but I won't kill my own.

548
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:34,669
Oh...!

549
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,510
But what the fuck are you doing?

550
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,311
-Ah...!

551
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:00,835
Give the order, Julian. -No.

552
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:05,596
(SHOUTS)

553
00:47:06,396 --> 00:47:10,796
-Have you had enough? We're leaving, damn it.

554
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:17,518
(SHOUTS) -Aaaaaah!

555
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,120
-Captain!

556
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,280
Captain, stop.

557
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:33,801
-Papi.

558
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:39,403
-Let me go.

559
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,003
Let me go.

560
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:47,084
-The man from heaven wants to talk to you.

561
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:07,236
-Tell me, commander.

562
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:10,117
-Captain, let's get on the ship.

563
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:13,237
We will undock from the station in 9 minutes.

564
00:48:13,278 --> 00:48:16,438
In 33 minutes we will cross the atmosphere.

565
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,439
In 45 minutes we will land near your position.

566
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,120
-We'll be there, Commander.

567
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:30,481
-Captain, thank you.

568
00:48:32,482 --> 00:48:36,122
The cyclone is more powerful than it seemed.

569
00:48:36,162 --> 00:48:41,042
Over 600 km of storm mass and growing.

570
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,044
We're going to have a bad time for a while.

571
00:48:46,084 --> 00:48:48,964
-It won't be the first time we've had a bad time.

572
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:51,005
Good flight, Commander.

573
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:18,531
Save the Star.

574
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:23,092
I'm going to have surgery.

575
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:25,572
Try not to let us move too much,

576
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:29,092
I don't want the doctor to cut the appendix that she shouldn't.

577
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:36,854
-Ricardo, we're doing the right thing.

578
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:41,375
It's either them or us.

579
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:46,656
-I know. It's always like this, one or the other.

580
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:16,342
-What do you think you're doing? -Well, the same as you.

581
00:50:16,383 --> 00:50:19,303
I'm going to clean like an idiot...

582
00:50:19,343 --> 00:50:23,183
...in the middle of a storm. -Yeah, but this is my turn.

583
00:50:23,224 --> 00:50:26,104
-And mine. -That's a lie, it's Piti's.

584
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:29,305
-Yeah, but Piti got dizzy and couldn't clean...

585
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:31,345
...and vomit at the same time.

586
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,190
What happened? What's changed, Ainhoa?

587
00:50:57,631 --> 00:51:01,711
Tell me, for God's sake. Tell me. Hey.

588
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:14,674
Is it because of something I've done, Ainhoa?

589
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,275
I know I can be a jerk sometimes, I know;

590
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:26,756
But I'll change. Tell me what's going on. Tell me.

591
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:29,277
I swear I'm going to change, Ainhoa.

592
00:51:29,317 --> 00:51:31,277
Tell me.

593
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:41,799
-You can force me to clean with you,

594
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,960
but not to talk to you.

595
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:02,084
(Door)

596
00:52:04,004 --> 00:52:05,324
-Forward.

597
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:15,206
-I have the third question. -Are you sure?

598
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:18,407
It's his last shot.

599
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:23,968
-If I were to confront you, if I were to jeopardize your plans,

600
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:26,929
would you kill me?

601
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,690
-I wouldn't hesitate for a second.

602
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:39,251
Where I come from, betrayal is paid for with death.

603
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:05,296
(English voices)

604
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,220
-What the hell are you doing, the crabs aren't hoisted?

605
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:26,021
I want the whole cloth unfolded, please!

606
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:30,381
-Where's Ricardo? I have to perform emergency surgery on him.

607
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:33,822
-He told me he was going to the infirmary. -Well, he didn't go.

608
00:53:33,863 --> 00:53:35,823
Call him over the PA system.

609
00:53:35,863 --> 00:53:39,943
At any time, your intestine can perforate.

610
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,704
-Ricardo, can you hear me?

611
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:46,305
(Whistle)

612
00:53:46,345 --> 00:53:47,865
It is not possible.

613
00:53:52,426 --> 00:53:55,026
The mother who... -What's wrong?

614
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:57,147
-Ricardo! Ricardo, can you hear me?

615
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:04,148
-Where are you going? -Outside.

616
00:54:16,631 --> 00:54:19,551
You son of a bitch!

617
00:54:23,753 --> 00:54:25,873
-Is it Ricardo? -Yes.

618
00:54:25,913 --> 00:54:29,393
-What do you intend? -To rescue the astronauts alone.

619
00:54:31,714 --> 00:54:34,034
-Hold me. -I think we should be...

620
00:54:34,115 --> 00:54:36,795
...in the cabins. -No, man, no.

621
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:40,636
-Wake.

622
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:45,076
Well, yes. Yes. I'm going to say yes.

623
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:48,437
To Piti. I love him, I want to be with him.

624
00:54:48,478 --> 00:54:51,118
(REMEMBER) "With Vilma, take it easy.

625
00:54:51,158 --> 00:54:53,678
If you overwhelm her, she runs away."

626
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,119
-Well, turn 70 degrees, sailor. You've got it on the port side.

627
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:05,560
-Piti, what... I've already thought about it...

628
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:09,201
...and I already have an answer. -Vilma, leave it.

629
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:14,282
Don't pay attention to me, I'm crazy.

630
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:16,843
You know how this end of the world thing is,

631
00:55:16,883 --> 00:55:21,963
everything is magnified. And I became magnified and confused.

632
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:39,047
You and I are friends, Vilma.

633
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:43,008
What am I supposed to be in love with you, it's absurd.

634
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:47,489
I'm sorry I put you in this predicament.

635
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,530
But that's it. A clean slate...

636
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:53,851
...and we start from scratch.

637
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:26,657
Look, if you can set me up with Estela,

638
00:56:26,738 --> 00:56:29,418
let's see if the flame is rekindled,

639
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:32,538
You can name your baby after me, for example.

640
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:47,141
-Ricardo, contest!

641
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:54,262
Ricardo, damn it! Answer! I'm seeing you in the boat!

642
00:56:54,303 --> 00:56:59,783
Turn around, damn it! Turn around, damn it!

643
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:03,904
You've got a typhoon blowing down your neck! Don't you realize?

644
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:07,345
At the first blow of the sea, you're going to go to hell!

645
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:14,586
Ricardo, for your mother's sake. You're in no condition to save anyone!

646
00:57:14,627 --> 00:57:18,867
You have to have surgery, what the fuck!

647
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:22,228
You're going to faint before those people fall into the sea!

648
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:25,909
Ricardo, for the holy virgin's sake! Answer!

649
00:57:48,194 --> 00:57:50,834
Answer me!

650
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,315
Answer me, damn it!

651
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:01,516
Ricardo, listen.

652
00:58:04,077 --> 00:58:05,477
I have cancer.

653
00:58:37,164 --> 00:58:38,524
-Let me go.

654
00:58:44,405 --> 00:58:48,405
-What the hell are you talking about? -About the prostate.

655
00:58:48,446 --> 00:58:51,606
Julia diagnosed me. I have some markers...

656
00:58:51,647 --> 00:58:55,487
...I don't know what kind of milk. On land I could be called,

657
00:58:55,528 --> 00:58:57,288
on the boat, not much.

658
00:59:03,889 --> 00:59:06,369
-If a wave were to swallow us right now,

659
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:15,091
Is this all I would want?

660
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:20,332
Just this?

661
00:59:24,213 --> 00:59:27,453
"Are you sure about that, Julian?" "I'm afraid so."

662
00:59:27,494 --> 00:59:30,054
That's why I need you not to kill yourself.

663
00:59:30,135 --> 00:59:34,335
Please. I won't be here forever,

664
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:37,696
but the people I love with all my soul, yes.

665
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:43,096
Ulysses, Salome. And you're going to have to take care of them, my friend.

666
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,701
-I don't love you.

667
01:00:12,503 --> 01:00:17,903
-Julian. Julian, I'm so sorry. -Ricardo, don't be so sorry.

668
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:20,664
Stop rowing, I'm coming for you. What the fuck.

669
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:45,869
-And if those astronauts are so important to you,

670
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,990
we will go look for them,

671
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,230
Let's see if with a bit of luck they can handle playing mus.

672
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:20,213
-His fever is over 40, I have to operate on him now.

673
01:01:20,254 --> 01:01:23,814
-The astronauts have fallen more than six miles from here.

674
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:27,295
-And the sea pushes them away. We need propulsion to get there.

675
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:30,455
What the fuck are we doing? (WALKIE) -"First Officer,

676
01:01:30,496 --> 01:01:33,096
We lose them. Should we lower the mainsail further?

677
01:01:33,137 --> 01:01:37,057
-No, or the wind will tear the sails. We have to lower them all.

678
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:40,897
-Lower all sail and keep visual contact with the ship.

679
01:01:40,938 --> 01:01:43,298
-Without fuel we won't be able to rescue them.

680
01:01:43,339 --> 01:01:45,619
-He's leaving us. We have to do something.

681
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:49,859
-Wait! Look, look...

682
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,700
Oars.

683
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:55,221
We have to build oars.

684
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:58,021
Mount an elevated structure in the dining room,

685
01:01:58,062 --> 01:02:01,462
and put rowers using the portholes as hatches.

686
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:04,742
-Like in the "Vicky the Viking" cartoons.

687
01:02:04,943 --> 01:02:06,903
-That's crazy!

688
01:02:06,943 --> 01:02:09,823
-It might work. We need floorboards,

689
01:02:09,904 --> 01:02:14,064
wooden crates... whatever, bunk beds. We only have ten minutes.

690
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:18,105
Ricardo, let's build those oars, damn it.

691
01:02:18,186 --> 01:02:23,026
I'll take care of it. And I want to see you later, buddy, don't mess with me.

692
01:02:23,187 --> 01:02:27,107
Acompáñale a la enfermería. -Ricardo, hay que operar. Vamos.

693
01:02:27,187 --> 01:02:29,987
To the infirmary! - You guys, come with me!

694
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:32,588
We have a job to do!

695
01:02:35,189 --> 01:02:37,749
-Come on, come on! -We'll play "where is it."

696
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,230
-Let's go.

697
01:02:47,192 --> 01:02:49,032
-Come on, come on.

698
01:02:49,072 --> 01:02:52,032
Come on, come on! -What's up?

699
01:02:52,073 --> 01:02:56,273
-Here. -Come on, guys.

700
01:02:56,313 --> 01:02:58,873
-Careful.

701
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:02,554
-First of all: make seats for each porthole.

702
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:06,475
First we use the tables, then you cross them, okay?

703
01:03:06,515 --> 01:03:08,315
Come on, come on, damn it!

704
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:09,956
-Come on, come on!

705
01:03:21,438 --> 01:03:24,158
-Come on, come on, come on!

706
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:37,601
-Are you guys okay? -Here.

707
01:03:40,202 --> 01:03:43,722
-We'll make a seat over there. Another one over there too.

708
01:03:43,763 --> 01:03:47,003
Well, without rushing. That's right, in order.

709
01:03:47,044 --> 01:03:48,964
-Come on, come on, come on!

710
01:03:49,004 --> 01:03:51,924
-Come on, let's go!

711
01:04:06,688 --> 01:04:08,928
-Julia, how are you?

712
01:04:08,968 --> 01:04:10,528
-GOOD.

713
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:20,490
-What's that? -Ricardo.

714
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:24,570
-Anesthesia. I'm going to sedate you. -No. Local anesthesia.

715
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,851
-I can't remove your appendix without local anesthesia.

716
01:04:27,892 --> 01:04:31,372
-Yes, I can! I have to perform a rescue. The walkie.

717
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:38,933
-Salomé, I'm not going to do it with local anesthesia.

718
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:42,654
-Attention, they should put pillows in the portholes to...

719
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:46,175
...that they support the oars well, and that they cover them with rags...

720
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,256
...or whatever the mangoes are. -Yes, my friend!

721
01:04:49,296 --> 01:04:53,296
Let's see, we use the pillows to protect the portholes!

722
01:04:53,337 --> 01:04:56,937
I want the oar handles covered with rags!

723
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:59,378
I don't want them to get hurt!

724
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:02,818
Don't move the porthole guards!

725
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:05,339
Very good, you are doing very well!

726
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:07,379
Five more minutes and that's it!

727
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,260
-I'm going to operate on you by giving orders through the walkie!

728
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,460
-Yes, without any stress, as if you were in position.

729
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:16,461
Yes, you're going to do it. -Salomé, I can't.

730
01:05:16,502 --> 01:05:19,982
I can't. -Look at my face.

731
01:05:20,022 --> 01:05:23,622
Yes you can because we trust you, and you know how to do it;

732
01:05:23,663 --> 01:05:26,383
him and me, and you're going to do it.

733
01:05:27,904 --> 01:05:31,024
(Shouting)

734
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:34,385
-Nothing's wrong! Let's keep going!

735
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,346
-Okay, come on.

736
01:05:38,386 --> 01:05:41,426
-Come on. Come on, honey.

737
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:00,390
-Ah!

738
01:06:00,431 --> 01:06:03,311
Oh my God!

739
01:06:07,912 --> 01:06:10,032
-Help!

740
01:06:10,073 --> 01:06:12,433
(Noise) Ah!

741
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,833
Help!

742
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:27,075
Who are you? Let me go.

743
01:06:27,156 --> 01:06:29,036
What do you want? Let me go! Let me go.

744
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,999
-Okay, let's get it on the floor. -Okay, little by little, okay?

745
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,400
-Careful, okay? -Come on, get those oars in the water!

746
01:07:05,244 --> 01:07:09,604
-Calm down. Take a deep breath.

747
01:07:11,205 --> 01:07:15,165
Okay, now tell me if you notice anything, okay?

748
01:07:17,926 --> 01:07:19,406
Do you notice anything?

749
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,007
And now? -No.

750
01:07:24,648 --> 01:07:26,328
-Go.

751
01:07:26,488 --> 01:07:28,688
(WALKIE) -"Ricardo".

752
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:31,288
-The walkie, quick!

753
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:35,009
-Ricardo, calm down. -I'm listening.

754
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,650
-We have the whole setup in the dining room.

755
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:42,451
The ship is 7.5 miles away, and we are ready to row.

756
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:54,453
Shall we give them the order, captain?

757
01:07:55,734 --> 01:08:13,094
-¡Remen!

758
01:08:13,097 --> 01:08:13,257
-Bubble, conduct this orchestra for me!

759
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:14,137
And... two!

760
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,660
And... and... three!

761
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:34,941
-What are you doing? Are you crazy? Let me go. Let me go.

762
01:08:34,982 --> 01:08:40,022
-In a matter of minutes my life will go to hell, Ainhoa;

763
01:08:44,104 --> 01:08:48,224
So, yeah, I'm crazy.

764
01:09:00,827 --> 01:09:02,867
(THEY SHOUT)

765
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:04,708
-Come on.

766
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:06,548
We continue.

767
01:09:06,628 --> 01:09:08,228
-Go on!

768
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,509
-Come on! (THEY SHOUT)

769
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:16,030
A!

770
01:09:19,871 --> 01:09:22,831
-Don't be afraid, doctor. I trust you.

771
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:33,273
Oh!

772
01:09:33,314 --> 01:09:36,914
-Help me put the dividers on. They're there, grab them.

773
01:09:38,715 --> 01:09:41,075
(THEY SHOUT)

774
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:42,915
-A!

775
01:09:42,956 --> 01:09:46,156
(THEY SHOUT)

776
01:09:50,157 --> 01:09:51,997
-Ah!

777
01:09:52,037 --> 01:09:53,837
Are you OK?

778
01:09:57,078 --> 01:09:59,198
I can't find it. -Please.

779
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:00,919
-Wait.

780
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,040
I can't find it.

781
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,560
Salome, please bring me the book, I need to see it.

782
01:10:10,601 --> 01:10:12,801
-Ah!

783
01:10:23,404 --> 01:10:26,204
-What are you doing? I have to go.

784
01:10:36,686 --> 01:10:38,526
(THEY SHOUT)

785
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,807
-Ten!

786
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:43,487
-Boys! -One!

787
01:10:43,528 --> 01:10:46,448
-I remind you that we are not dancers,

788
01:10:46,488 --> 01:10:48,528
we are sailors!

789
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,770
-Yes, I think I have it. -Yes?

790
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,650
(Whining)

791
01:10:59,491 --> 01:11:03,811
-Salomé, the vacuum cleaner. We need more suction. Quickly.

792
01:11:03,852 --> 01:11:05,892
Quick, put it on.

793
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:13,574
-I'm broken, Ainhoa.

794
01:11:16,615 --> 01:11:19,815
You say you don't love me and I don't understand.

795
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:24,936
Make him understand. -Let me out.

796
01:11:24,976 --> 01:11:28,056
-Convince me that you really don't love me.

797
01:11:28,457 --> 01:11:32,337
I swear I'll disappear from your life forever, I swear.

798
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:38,619
-Salomé, you're losing a lot of blood. Gauze.

799
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:40,659
Soak the gauze.

800
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,420
-From the Block. -Captain!

801
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,580
-Ricardo, please. -Situation.

802
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,100
-Go.

803
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,981
-Three! (They shout)

804
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:52,421
-Again!

805
01:11:52,422 --> 01:11:54,422
A!

806
01:11:58,103 --> 01:12:02,343
-Ricardo, target five miles, five miles.

807
01:12:02,424 --> 01:12:05,984
Damn, we have a cyclone right over our heads.

808
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:11,985
I've never seen anything like it in my life. The sea is coming in on our port side,

809
01:12:12,026 --> 01:12:14,386
we have to compensate for the rowing.

810
01:12:14,426 --> 01:12:17,266
-Help yourself with the rudder to compensate...

811
01:12:17,307 --> 01:12:21,267
...and make sure the sea doesn't get in... from the side.

812
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,589
-I made a mistake.

813
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:31,069
I thought it was you, but I was wrong.

814
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:35,390
You were a whim,

815
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,830
a nonsense.

816
01:12:43,272 --> 01:12:46,272
And I thought I could love you, but I couldn't.

817
01:12:50,153 --> 01:12:52,313
-No me convences.

818
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,756
-If you say you love me,

819
01:13:06,677 --> 01:13:09,677
leave me alone, I beg you.

820
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:13,077
Please leave me alone forever.

821
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:22,999
-Okay. I'll get away from you, but first I'm going to kiss you.

822
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:27,881
Kisses don't lie, Ainhoa.

823
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:31,841
It's just that, a kiss, nothing more.

824
01:13:38,003 --> 01:13:39,483
-Go!

825
01:13:39,523 --> 01:13:43,243
-Guys, one! (SCREAMING)

826
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:47,484
-We're going overboard. Starboard only. Bubble, can you hear me?

827
01:13:47,525 --> 01:13:50,565
-Starboard only. Not you.

828
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:53,446
Ready...Go!

829
01:13:53,486 --> 01:13:56,486
One! (SCREAMING)

830
01:13:57,647 --> 01:13:59,847
Of the!

831
01:13:59,888 --> 01:14:02,568
-I'm going to section the appendix.

832
01:14:02,608 --> 01:14:06,608
-Okay. -I need you to clip it here, like this,

833
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:09,729
and don't let it go for anything in the world. -Good.

834
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:11,490
(THEY SHOUT)

835
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:16,650
-Vilma! -Vilma, are you okay?

836
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:19,291
-Yes. -Come on! Let's go!

837
01:14:19,332 --> 01:14:22,812
One! (SCREAMING)

838
01:14:22,852 --> 01:14:24,772
AND...

839
01:14:25,453 --> 01:14:27,613
-Ricardo. Ricardo?

840
01:14:27,653 --> 01:14:32,493
-Ricardo, we're two miles away. -Keep rowing.

841
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:35,214
-You heard the captain.

842
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:39,095
Keep rowing, for your fucking life.

843
01:14:39,136 --> 01:14:41,416
Keep rowing, let's go!

844
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,816
-Don't come any closer. Stay still!

845
01:14:46,057 --> 01:14:49,457
-We're at five boat lengths, one more effort, guys.

846
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:57,699
-That's it. -That's it.

847
01:14:57,739 --> 01:15:00,219
-He's losing a lot of blood.

848
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:09,701
-Four lengths! That's it! That's it!

849
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:13,262
A few more strokes and we'll have them. That's it!

850
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:18,983
-Eh!

851
01:15:22,104 --> 01:15:24,504
(Beeps)

852
01:15:24,545 --> 01:15:26,345
-¿Ricardo?

853
01:15:27,825 --> 01:15:30,225
-Two lengths! That's it!

854
01:15:33,547 --> 01:15:36,347
-Ricardo! -You're going to help me lay a track.

855
01:15:36,387 --> 01:15:38,747
We're going to give you a transfusion. - You?

856
01:15:38,788 --> 01:15:42,668
-Yes, I'm a universal donor. There, where the syringes are.

857
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:45,108
-One boat! We're almost there!

858
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:47,749
-Put pressure on the wound. -With both hands?

859
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:51,229
-Yes, push him. Hard. -Run, baby, run.

860
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:53,190
Ricardo, please.

861
01:15:59,232 --> 01:16:01,232
-And another one!

862
01:16:09,394 --> 01:16:11,274
And another one.

863
01:16:29,238 --> 01:16:32,878
And another one. Until the captain says something.

864
01:16:32,919 --> 01:16:37,279
-Stop. Stop rowing. We've arrived, we've got them there.

865
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,560
Good job.

866
01:17:12,807 --> 01:17:14,367
-Do you remember?

867
01:17:18,048 --> 01:17:20,488
Just like our first date, huh?

868
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:32,570
-The show's over. We're getting ready to raise the ship,

869
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:34,731
okay? -Okay. Come on, Jose.

870
01:17:34,771 --> 01:17:37,291
-Carefully, but also with shine.

871
01:17:41,252 --> 01:17:43,332
-That's it?

872
01:17:43,373 --> 01:17:48,973
Are we out of the cyclone yet? (STAMMERS) - No, it's the eye.

873
01:17:49,014 --> 01:17:53,174
We are in the middle of the eye of the cyclone.

874
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:57,255
That's why it doesn't rain.

875
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:03,336
Isn't it beautiful?

876
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,779
-That's it.

877
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,700
Oh, sorry.

878
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:22,580
-You are forgiven.

879
01:18:22,581 --> 01:18:26,781
And it has nothing to do with the fact that he just saved my life.

880
01:18:29,902 --> 01:18:33,102
This is no time for apologies,

881
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:37,623
but I'm sorry I doubted you...

882
01:18:37,664 --> 01:18:41,464
...and called her a liar.

883
01:18:41,505 --> 01:18:46,265
-That's because I gave him my blood.

884
01:18:49,986 --> 01:18:52,586
-Blood with a little bit of joy.

885
01:18:54,227 --> 01:18:58,227
If the Civil Guard stops you, you break the breathalyzer.

886
01:18:58,268 --> 01:19:03,508
-Did you operate on me while drunk? -No, drunkenness...

887
01:19:03,549 --> 01:19:06,229
...it just passed me by, believe me.

888
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:11,270
-Well, the truth is that I've been high all day too.

889
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:18,751
-Don't come any closer, please.

890
01:19:19,592 --> 01:19:22,672
Stop! Don't come any closer!

891
01:19:24,273 --> 01:19:27,513
-You're going to have to shoot.

892
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:55,423
(CRYING) - Please don't come any closer. Please, I beg you.

893
01:19:55,503 --> 01:19:58,343
Don't come any closer. -Fire that harpoon...

894
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:02,384
...it's the only way you can make me think you don't love me,

895
01:20:02,505 --> 01:20:04,305
Ainhoa.

896
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:07,345
-Take it down carefully.

897
01:20:15,868 --> 01:20:17,548
-Ah!

898
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:49,754
-Some more!

899
01:20:51,755 --> 01:20:54,755
It's worth it, it's worth it!

900
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,038
-Ricardo, we have her.

901
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,279
-Get those men out of there right now.

902
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,600
-Guys, you open the hatch.

903
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,800
-Let's go.

904
01:21:30,003 --> 01:21:33,523
(CRIES)

905
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:47,045
-What? -There's no one.

906
01:21:47,086 --> 01:21:49,806
There's no one here, officer.

907
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:57,967
-Ricardo, the ship is empty.

908
01:21:58,608 --> 01:22:03,568
They're not there. The astronauts aren't there.

909
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:15,651
(CRIES)

910
01:22:23,413 --> 01:22:26,893
(ALL) - Here! Here!

911
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:29,094
-Please!

912
01:22:29,135 --> 01:22:32,015
-We have seen hundreds of people die.

913
01:22:32,055 --> 01:22:36,015
-He's saying he's willing to let those people die...

914
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:39,496
...20 meters from their boat. - They're also...

915
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,457
...survivors, Captain, just like us.

916
01:22:42,497 --> 01:22:44,057
-It's algae!

917
01:22:44,098 --> 01:22:46,258
(Noise) -Now!

918
01:22:46,298 --> 01:22:48,538
Oh!

919
01:22:48,578 --> 01:22:51,298
(SHOUTS) -Who were you talking to?

920
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:54,859
-Something is happening on the ship, but we don't know what it is.

921
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,340
-I'll do whatever you want. -Are you sure?

922
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,220
-Yes, please. I swear.

923
01:22:59,261 --> 01:23:03,301
-It's an epidemic! We're going to die! -It's important that it doesn't spread.

924
01:23:03,341 --> 01:23:05,461
-It's spreading throughout the ship.

925
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:08,702
-They could have anthrax, chickenpox, hemorrhagic fever...

926
01:23:08,743 --> 01:23:11,183
Most of them are fatal diseases.

927
01:23:11,223 --> 01:23:12,943
-They're here. -Let's go!

928
01:23:13,023 --> 01:23:15,383
Everyone to the cabins!

929
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:19,184
-Gamboa, you still haven't explained to me how you survived a week...

930
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:20,825
…adrift.

931
01:23:22,545 --> 01:23:26,865
-That's a transponder. -I didn't think you knew so much.

932
01:23:26,906 --> 01:23:29,666
-I'm not going to let you hurt Bubble.

933
01:23:29,707 --> 01:23:33,107
-He's more to blame for what happened than anyone else.

934
01:23:33,148 --> 01:23:36,828
-It hurts a lot. Something's not right.

935
01:23:36,868 --> 01:23:38,708
-Ah!

936
01:23:38,749 --> 01:23:41,709
-The consequences of what you've done...

937
01:23:41,749 --> 01:23:45,829
...they're way above you. They're way above me.

938
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:50,230
I thought you'd never be a problem again.

939
01:23:50,271 --> 01:23:54,551
-I wish everything was as easy as letting go and dancing.

940
01:23:54,592 --> 01:23:57,472
- Are we going to dance on the boat? - Yes.

941
01:23:57,512 --> 01:24:00,192
-Don't even think about taking off your apron.

942
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:02,833
For me you're always on Sunday, blonde.

943
01:24:02,874 --> 01:24:05,114
-If I could move, I'd kiss you.

944
01:24:05,154 --> 01:24:07,274
-I've fallen in love with you.

945
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:34,759
-Put your butt up. (LAUGHS)

946
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,000
-Look how pretty she is.

947
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:44,121
-Ricardo. Ri...

948
01:24:47,643 --> 01:24:50,283
-Prepare me a good penance,

949
01:24:50,283 --> 01:24:53,323
because I'm going to sin on all four sides.

950
01:24:53,324 --> 01:24:57,124
-I hate you and there's nothing in this world you can do...

951
01:24:57,245 --> 01:24:59,685
...for that to change.

952
01:24:59,885 --> 01:25:02,405
-Ah!

953
01:25:03,526 --> 01:25:06,006
-Ah!

954
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:27,010
-Your nightmare is over. This ship is your new home...

955
01:25:27,051 --> 01:25:31,491
...and all of us, his family. Welcome to the Estrella Polar.

01:25:31,531 --> 01:25:34,251
(Applause)

957
01:25:34,292 --> 01:25:37,252
-I have a message for you.
