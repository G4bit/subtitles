1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,010
PREVIOUSLY...

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,430
I'm Ricardo Montero, and I'll be your captain.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,010
on the training ship, the Polar Star, for the next two months.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,760
The particle accelerator will start at 9 am in the Geneva conventions.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,930
I don't like you.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,850
It?

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,010
The Polar Star, speaks a training ship.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,680
There is a growing storm coming our way.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,100
- Are you copying? - Where is my mother?

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,350
Don't teach me how to raise my daughter.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,850
while your son is locked in the hold.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,100
- I came to meet my father. With The approach of the storm, is suicidal.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,850
Each of those red dots are not part of the ship, sending the year of the SAUCE.

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,260
Turn the ship around! If we go, we all die!

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,850
No, the harbour master of the cloud, the rescue unit...

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,430
It was as if everyone had disappeared.

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,680
When you're away from home

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,600
What do you miss most in the world is in your bed.

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,510
Well, for my sisters Birthday, it's the bathroom.

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,600
She says she can only do things comfortably at home.

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,180
But after that, it's the bed.

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,260
Mom used to say, there's no place like home to sleep.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,760
Because you have, in your dream, the sheets smell like the conditioner that you use at home

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,430
- and street noises don't wake you up.

25
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,100
Well, what does she look like, man? - Here.

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,680
She's beautiful! - Look, you're not afraid to go out at night.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,930
to the kitchen to drink water.

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,600
And.

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,180
And you'll miss, lying on the carpet, too.

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,890
and turning the TV on very low,

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,760
so that Mommy doesn't wake you up and send you to bed.

32
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,510
This is the training ship of the Polar Star, sending out the year in the SAUCE.

33
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,100
This is the training ship of the Polar Star, sending out the year in the SAUCE.

34
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,100
This is the training ship of the Polar Star, sending out the year in the SAUCE.

35
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,050
Anyone out there? I can't believe no one is listening to it.

36
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,260
This is the training ship of the Polar Star, sending out the year in the SAUCE.

37
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,010
Well, you'll miss everything about the house.

38
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,430
There is no better place in the world.

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,350
That's why when we play tag during recess,

40
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,510
you'll have to say "home" to avoid getting caught.

41
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,350
It took me half an hour to convince him to put the ship in irons here.

42
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,760
- What excuse did you make up? - Not to mention the project

43
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,430
that we had to do biological tests in the area.

44
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,760
He's actually quite kind.

45
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,260
- Intimate. How intimate?

46
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,260
He saw the plush panties you gave me.

47
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,100
He's actually quite nice. Actually...

48
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,100
...to repair the broken pipe...

49
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,350
Sealing of the security class to fix the pipe that broke during transit.

50
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,010
A mistake in passing, and they moved on.

51
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,600
Come on.

52
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,760
We have an unfinished conversation. Don't you think?

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,140
Come on.

54
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,680
In your RESUME, you say you have a phd in medicine and biology,

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,100
but you didn't say anything about traveling with it in your carry-on.

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,180
I'm so sorry about what happened. You pointed the gun at me.

57
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,850
I could lock you in a cabin until I hand you over to the harbor master's degree.

58
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,100
You knew it wasn't a normal storm.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
And that we wouldn't sink if we stayed within the marked coordinates.

60
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,680
I think you owe me an explanation. Don't you?

61
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,050
THROWING THE GAME

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,350
Please.

63
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,850
Please.

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,350
Max.

65
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,850
Leave the TV on, we have to make the choice.

66
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,850
There is no reception offshore.

67
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,760
Yes, but I have an antenna and I'm always tuning into something.

68
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,760
Sometimes they speak Chinese, English, or other strange languages.

69
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,930
But the heroes of the storm

70
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,180
nothing. The internet doesn't work either.

71
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,260
I have nine friends on Facebook and I'm not there.

72
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,680
Well, let's make breakfast.

73
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,180
Also, why do you want to watch TV in Black? No reason. Come on.

74
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,300
Xièxie míng tian jiàn.

75
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,180
So they said good-bye to the news from china.

76
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,100
- ... tian jiàn. Don't piss me off.

77
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,010
Come on, Please, let's have breakfast. Quick!

78
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,350
Oh, Julia, I don't want it to be secret, or the cargo of mysterious ship of mine.

79
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,680
What's inside these boxes? A shipment of rifles, a Kalashnikov?

80
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,850
No, no, no, of course not. I'll explain everything to you, but I need more time.

81
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,350
I want you to be safe.

82
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,600
Ricardo.

83
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,430
It doesn't look good at all.

84
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,760
The storm knocked out the electronics of the ship, and I don't have the coverage of a satellite.

85
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,350
And we've fixed the two waterways in the engine room with a broom.

86
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,100
Captain fieruri, and continued to try to go to the Headquarters of the high Command.

87
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,010
What? - Nothing, nothing.

88
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,430
Where are we?

89
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,010
All night long I've mapped out the routes of the astrolabe and the compass,

90
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,430
and, according to my calculations, it would have to be at the front of the Lanzarotei

91
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,510
and I can't see the ground anywhere out there.

92
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,430
Good day to you.

93
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Let me see it.

94
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,260
I must have done something wrong. Right here.

95
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,100
All of the people here did something wrong.

96
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,600
I must have been hit by alizée that have changed the course, and we turned back.

97
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,850
The graphics of the new route. What the hell are you doing?

98
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,930
- To me it smells like a dog in heat. You are the odor. Of course, they are.

99
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,600
For me, I've been burning the midnight oil earth and you, flirt with the Doctor.

100
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I saw you hugging you at the time of the storm, and now you just came out of her room.

101
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,600
Ricardo, you have a 15 year old. Well...

102
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,600
And this isn't a school field trip. - I just had a conversation about my work.

103
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,010
Is that clear? Clear.

104
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,930
Worth it, oh, baby, I'm your daddy. What do you do?

105
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,680
Valeria? - Yes, I am. Hold on.

106
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,010
Is there something wrong with that? Worth it. Why did you lock the door?

107
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,430
I was just getting dressed. - Getting an early start to feel bad about.

108
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,010
What is this?

109
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,430
You've made your bed, honey? Are you made of? Well, it's just so beautiful. But the last wash, tumble,

110
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,760
so, you'll need to get the sheets. Oh, come on, help me out.

111
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,010
I don't, I don't need you, daddy. I'm not dirty.

112
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,680
She has a strong character for a five-year-old.

113
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,640
She's going to end up with the orders on a pontier. You just take the bed sheets.

114
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,850
But you're right. If you're not dirty, we'll clean it up.

115
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,430
Thus, we are going to pour more soap into the big one. All right? Come on, go get yourself some breakfast.

116
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,390
All right.

117
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,760
What should I do now?

118
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,430
Just change the bottom sheet.

119
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,350
They would be able to see the coast, about two hours ago, and you need to go from page to page.

120
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,260
What are we doing Anymore?

121
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,010
Hey, good morning, Polar Star.

122
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,640
It's all clear.

123
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,350
- Make room! - Today's schedule.

124
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,470
Breakfast is at 8 in the morning

125
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,760
At 7 in the morning, in the Canary Islands

126
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,850
but, well, since we're in the middle of the road at Las Palmas,

127
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,510
we're going to use the time of the island, 7

128
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Breakfast is at 7 in the morning

129
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,350
YOUR BUSINESS AND PERSONAL

130
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,850
-Go on, father, it's up to us. - Check in at Las Palmas in order to repair the ship.

131
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,350
At 18: 30.

132
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,180
You have two hours to get his personal affairs.

133
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,510
Oh, come on! It's all clear.

134
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,260
Oh, come on!

135
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,140
Come on, you guys! - Oh, come on!

136
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,220
Hey, hey, hey you crazy!

137
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,260
- This is so beautiful. - Go on, father.

138
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,220
Go, go, go, father.

139
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,930
What was that about? What? Don't you do it?

140
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,930
Stop.

141
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,260
Hey, hey, hey, to be the daughter of the Captain, you're not that great at tying knots.

142
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,680
Do you know what I'm really good at it? Please, please, please.

143
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,600
The detection of fools on a 200-mile radius.

144
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,760
Hold on.

145
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,180
In order to have a radar gun so wide,

146
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,510
I don't think you're close enough?

147
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,680
You can get the bikini back, don't you?

148
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,010
Or you want to give it a shot?

149
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,760
The other day.

150
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,100
Right here.

151
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,510
It's hot, isn't it?

152
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,010
This is so beautiful!

153
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,350
Hey, don't touch it with your foot! - I'm not touching you!

154
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,100
And the spoon? I can't get to them.

155
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,760
The Earth shook as a zdrănător and changed its magnetic field.

156
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,430
That's why the utensils were zăvorit up at the sky. Don't you remember?

157
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,350
Because of the fact that the storm took place in the center of the Earth.

158
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,600
What the hell is going on here?

159
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,930
I don't hold it against him. I guess I thought it was funny, and it was at that age.

160
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,850
The ship, isn't it?

161
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,430
Professor of biology? - I don't. I'd like to be.

162
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,010
I'm a graduate student, and I'm not a biologist.

163
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,010
In Colombia, the brothers, who live in Barranquilla, there is no way for you to study.

164
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,600
Gamboa, a professor of the faculty of physical education and survival skills.

165
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,100
- Nice to meet you. Good to see you.

166
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,350
Hey, guys, did you feel that?

167
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,010
It's disgusting. - Duck, it ain't funny, man.

168
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,850
- Oh, am I? I swear it wasn't me. Come On, I Cringe.

169
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,930
Damn, I feel like I have something.

170
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,930
What is this? - It is, But what the hell is this, man?

171
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,100
This put a lot of! This put a lot of!

172
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,760
- Jenny! - The ship!

173
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,010
Get out of the water quickly. Quickly, come on!

174
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,350
Come on out, come on come on. Oh, come on!

175
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,180
Get out of my way. It's not going to stop touching it.

176
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,430
Give me your hand.

177
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,180
What happened to you? Let's go to the nursery.

178
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
- I need to go pee-pee on the sting. No!

179
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,180
I saw it in a movie, pee-pee is ammonia...

180
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,930
I'll cut it off, I Cringe.

181
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,680
That's it. You're a clown. The fool with the chewing gum.

182
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,260
You're going to tell the next joke, the big roof.

183
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,390
The fool with the chewing-gum

184
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,850
it is the same as on the first day, second-day,

185
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,600
on the third day,

186
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,600
in the rest of the day.

187
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,850
Come on, now!

188
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,100
- Take a seat, please! Take it to the left.

189
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,100
You.

190
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,180
Well, if you think that you have arrived on this ship, you take off your belt and a bra, then you're wrong.

191
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,350
Why? Are you the bully?

192
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,180
- Of course. - When you grow up without a father figure,

193
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,930
it's easy to get off track, you know?

194
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,010
But now that I've found you - I-you, you idiot.

195
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,600
If you're doing it again.

196
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,430
My family is my ship, and the Captain. Got it?

197
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,850
- This baby... hey, Hey, one more thing.

198
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,430
I hope you guys like cats

199
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,680
the cards of the game, feeding the pigeons...

200
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,180
For more than a couple of years ago, I can see you wearing a sweatshirt and on to the work.

201
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,680
People just like you.

202
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,510
to end up alone.

203
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,350
My dad.

204
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,100
You're the one who's going to be all alone.

205
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,100
But the cleaning of the fish is frozen. And I don't want to see you out on the deck.

206
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,180
Let's see if you're on the way to get to work and to unlock the bra.

207
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,760
Take out the earring.

208
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,930
It's a piece of advice as a father, or an order of the prime amate?

209
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,430
For an order. Well, I don't want to.

210
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,100
Lay it down. What happened to you?

211
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,180
Something poked me in the water.

212
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,760
It was like a jelly fish a jelly fish.

213
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,010
Yes, it was a jellyfish on the atomic scale.

214
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,510
Did you see how fast he had moved on? It was a shark, or something else.

215
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,680
I wasn't doing anything. Stand still. - A big blow.

216
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,010
All RIGHT.

217
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,260
Well, no, it's not.

218
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,180
It could be a flat tire.

219
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,100
A breakdown on some of the fish for a shed to protect you.

220
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,510
The swelling and sting...

221
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,600
- There's a poison. I got the shot wound? - I don't.

222
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,350
I Don't I Don't. No You Don't!

223
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,600
No You Don't! - Spit it out, dad.

224
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,100
No You Don't!

225
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,390
Let me see it, let's shoot some poison.

226
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,600
- It's the 100-mg dose of hydrocortisone. In any case, the doctor. I don't inject it.

227
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,470
She can suck it until I get a brain, but not cortisol.

228
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,350
Doctor, will you check the pulse of this, and it doesn't sting.

229
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,890
Tonight, the brazier with his eyes bulged. But what is it?

230
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,930
Don't touch it. Just leave it there and walk away.

231
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,350
Come out!!! Get away from him. Come on, everyone in the class.

232
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,180
Everyone in the class. Oh, come on! Out!!!

233
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,350
Out. Palomares, on the outside.

234
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,100
Come on, please. Out.

235
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,180
So, how have you been. Good morning to you.

236
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,100
You are here - Dad, please, please, please.

237
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,600
All right.

238
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,260
- What is it? - It's good.

239
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,430
With your classmates? Do you fit in? Yes, it's great.

240
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,010
They are really cool and you don't have to be seasick.

241
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,550
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

242
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,510
But if I find out who's got you nice to meet you, I'll squeeze in on the main-mast.

243
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,180
And it's not like a father, but also as a captain.

244
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,850
All right. I can see it now. Bye-bye.

245
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,600
My daughter.

246
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,510
Oh well, I'll wet the bed?

247
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,470
My mom and I pulled his diaper when he was two years old

248
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,390
and that's when it was wet. Why?

249
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,010
Until today.

250
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,050
Have you seen her, or did she tell you? - I don't do it. It was the other way around.

251
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,350
She had made her bed and covered her up so I don't see it.

252
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,260
- Poor thing, she must be so embarrassed. Yeah, what do I do?

253
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,760
- All right. I'll talk to her?

254
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,260
They forbid the water, at night? I put a small box on the bed, a sanitary napkin? Baby, you're my mother used to take care of these things.

255
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,180
My dad.

256
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,640
Just relax, okay?

257
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,260
You're doing just fine.

258
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,180
And Valeria is a very, very happy to be here.

259
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,800
It is just a child of five years old, and the five-year-olds wet their beds.

260
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,390
It's all right.

261
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,350
I don't do anything to change his bed sheets, and the...

262
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,100
And they act like normal. - Of course, but how?

263
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,600
If you pay attention, she's going to think that this is a problem.

264
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,010
So, the norm of the absolute.

265
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,260
Normal. Normal.

266
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,260
Come on over here.

267
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,680
Hey there!

268
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,930
Here is the flag of a pirate.

269
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,930
Very, very good.

270
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,550
You get in your bikini and you take out the garbage. We're even.

271
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,180
Right, smutch?

272
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,010
- The Snitch. Yes.

273
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,850
Who do you think you are?

274
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,180
Rip my panties and have some fun

275
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,850
and it's got your back. Or how does it work? - I don't know I don't like to fly.

276
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,100
But your father won't like to be topless on a boat.

277
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,600
Your father won't like that you leave empty all along the corridor.

278
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,930
You are so right.

279
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,470
Because I can't leave it on your head.

280
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,680
Hey, hey, hey so if you can't get rid of the smell

281
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,850
you call your mom and let her to give you a hand as you've had since you were a little girl.

282
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,430
Oh, My God.

283
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,850
Where are you going?

284
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,430
I asked you where you were going.

285
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,600
Take a look at me now! Where are you going?

286
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,680
An Idiot.

287
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,470
Don't even try to tell my mom, right?

288
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,430
You can call me whatever you want, but don't say a word about my mother.

289
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,430
The Snitch.

290
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,180
We are all fucked up.

291
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,510
The more you know about Jenny?

292
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,180
It's still in the nursery, but the doctor says he's in no immediate danger. It's stable.

293
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,930
Do you know what's up with that?

294
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,350
I don't.

295
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,510
Damn it, I jumped! Shut the front door. Come on over here.

296
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,510
What are you doing, man? - I'm a man of action.

297
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,680
You see, I don't want you to embarrass me.

298
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,430
I'm not going to do the trick siamese cat.

299
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,010
Don't tell me to turn the other cheek. I won't say a word to me. Don't you think that I didn't do this kind of stuff in the workshop.

300
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,430
They should be able to create an atmosphere for the rest of the class. It's not good.

301
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,180
Look at this guy, he's cocky. If you don't turn it off on the first day, he's going to humiliate you in every single day of this curse.

302
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,760
Wait, wait. - He is coming!

303
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,430
It's coming!!

304
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,100
Good morning. Good morning.

305
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,600
Well, my name is Ernesto Gamboa.

306
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,180
with me, you're going to, you know, what's around you.

307
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,680
This is how you do it,

308
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,510
how do you survive when things get ugly.

309
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,260
Damn it.

310
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,350
The ship, the training of the Polar Star, is calling on the Headquarters of the high Command.

311
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,260
Navigate without a GPS.

312
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,850
I need the exact location of the ship on cruise control. Over it.

313
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,680
- The Polar Star, her name workout - - there's No radio, TELEVISION, and the internet.

314
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,180
Can't find the Island. What's the deal? I don't know what it is? Just let me know.

315
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,510
Now, the chef knows all about the navigation?

316
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,010
Do you want to be in charge? - No, no, I don't.

317
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,680
But I'll tell you all about how she knows the chef.

318
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,010
On treating people nicely.

319
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,010
I don't like you.

320
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,100
Do you treat your son like he's a piece of shit.

321
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,010
And do you know why? In order that I might have to hate you for it you don't get the hate on anyone but yourself.

322
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,850
In the last 20 years we've been together, I haven't told her anything ever again. But you have to be a bitch to get off,

323
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,450
left her panties and dinner is on the table, and I was in there.

324
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,110
Today, of course.

325
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,450
I have no idea why I'm out of the house.

326
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,530
Said, you don't have it.

327
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,110
Well, it turns out that what I was stung was not an idiot, aren't you?

328
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,450
Julia, what can I do with the poison?

329
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,610
This wound is so much better, anti-histamine, it worked.

330
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,530
Check you out with your scanner to see if there is any damage to the blood vessels.

331
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,360
This does not have any of the risk.

332
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,780
All right.

333
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,950
- He's trying to stay calm, okay? - All right.

334
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,950
I don't get a move on, please.

335
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,780
Help! Anyone out there?

336
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,030
Hello.

337
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,950
I don't.

338
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,030
Can you?

339
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,860
It's over, Please. You can't go back now.

340
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,780
You're not going to die because of what he got, right?

341
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,700
It is a baby, the abyssal careproctus.

342
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,450
A fish that can live up to 5000 meters depth.

343
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,360
For a child who lives in the 5000 metres below the surface?

344
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,530
- Oh, my god, what if he is a child, so how is she to him? Large.

345
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,530
Large. You need to be a big thing, if it thins the child is six inches in length,

346
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,450
mom you have to be twenty years of age. And...

347
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:14,030
And, if that is the twenties, my mother has a 12-feet in length. Like this one.

348
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,700
Twelve feet tall? - More or less.

349
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,530
In Julia, but it's not impossible.

350
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,280
Sometimes, it may happen the impossible things. Sometimes, it may happen the impossible things.

351
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,200
Have you heard of it?

352
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,360
This is the area of the hull.

353
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,030
Help!

354
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,360
Anyone out there? Hello.

355
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,950
Anyone out there?

356
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,860
Do you have some muscles? It's so good.

357
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,300
No, seriously, girl, cheer up. We're gonna get to do it at any time.

358
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,460
When I shut the engine off, we're gonna get you out of here, okay? Seriously, calm down, calm down.

359
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,960
We're at minus 20 degrees celsius. I'll put up with no more than half an hour.

360
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,550
Right. But we do have a little bit of anti-freeze.

361
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,300
The alcohol is removed with the cold, don't you? And it makes your life more joyful, for that you will need.

362
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,460
Alcohol is a vasodilator.

363
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,630
You are going to cause you to lose heat more quickly, and you will be out of the tissues.

364
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,050
And, yes, the rhythm of the heart would stop bit by bit.

365
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,550
Why don't you get bored with the 1000 ways to die in the freezer?

366
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,960
Please, please, please. I'm so sorry.

367
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,130
Are you cold?

368
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,300
- I don't. - Don't you?

369
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,800
Your t-shirt doesn't say the exact same thing.

370
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,300
Oh, my god.

371
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,880
You're a fucking idiot. - Am I?

372
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,800
If you continue to jump on, all you will do is to lose calories faster.

373
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,550
Are you going to give me the lessons to survival?

374
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,960
The only clothes you're wearing are met.

375
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,550
Just take it off.

376
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,630
Her clothes are wet and you're gonna freeze to death.

377
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,210
Put this on.

378
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm not going to forget it. I'll be back.

379
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,210
Put this on.

380
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,960
Right here.

381
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,630
Do you know how to give it to me, please? - Oh, yes, here you are.

382
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,050
Do you want to make a soup, bouillabaisse eyes bulged?

383
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,800
- The Bubble, what is it? - It's a fish.

384
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,210
A fish that is at least 5,000 feet.

385
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,960
What is he doing here? 't be able to live on the water, he burned it.

386
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,050
Why did he burn it?

387
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,800
Because people don't realize it,

388
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,460
for that, I don't know, but the sea is 6 degrees warmer.

389
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,960
Why is it so?

390
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,130
For the same reason, and with a knife and fork, because the Earth is shaking

391
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,880
and the lava that came out of the bottom of the sea.

392
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,960
You have to be out a lot of the lava, to heat up the whole of the ocean.

393
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,880
Oh well, I'll leave it here.

394
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,710
- For the Home. We can't be in the National Park of picos de europa.

395
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,960
- Out of the building. - ¿Qué?

396
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:00,050
Why? My daughter is in the cabin shy

397
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,630
for that, you hung up the sheets from the boom to the spots of pee and all that stuff.

398
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,300
Leave them out on the bed, it is difficult to remove the smell.

399
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,630
They can stay up there till the moss grows.

400
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,800
The ship is telling me that I need to normalize things and you'll be humiliated.

401
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,630
Give him the ears of an ass, and a walk to the bridge for the world to laugh!

402
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,960
Damn it, he's five years old.

403
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,550
I'm so sorry. I don't know, I just do it without thinking about it.

404
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,550
Ricardo, don't worry about it. Also, I'm going to normalize things up the next time you see her.

405
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,460
We are a family. I'm her uncle.

406
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,550
I need to learn how to deal with a child of five years old.

407
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,460
I can teach you. You can find his son after 20 years of age and to turn it off.

408
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,880
You're a sick man, Julian. Sick!

409
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,960
You're a sick man, uncle Julian? What's the matter with you?

410
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:46,460
No, it's nothing, baby. It is not sick. Uncle Julian is not.

411
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,880
Your dad was mad at me.

412
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,630
'Cause I wet the bed again.

413
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,130
Are you-are you serious?

414
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,550
Yes, my dear. And you know what?

415
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,960
It turns out that, along with the sound of the waves is my turn on the tap and you're done! I get wet every night. As an old mule.

416
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
I don't even have pajamas.

417
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,880
In the box, the number 23, you will find the whole of the protocol of action

418
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,710
in the event of an accident.

419
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,050
Start the protocol of action in the event of a disaster.

420
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,210
In fact, it is possible for an accident to the launch of a particle accelerator

421
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,800
he went up to the consequences of the proportions of the immeasurable.

422
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,550
The safest assumption is that it was generated by a black hole

423
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,960
and took about 500 cubic kilometres-of mass frame.

424
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,880
If this is the case,

425
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,880
The earth is positively different.

426
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,630
Do you know that the first step of the protocol is to assess the situation. In this case, the number 23, you'll find a receiver of a satellite image.

427
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,710
Hispasat 14 will be broadcast every hour.

428
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,630
You'll be able to check the extent to which the planet has been devastated.

429
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,460
And the good thing about all of this ...

430
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:03,130
it's you and me, we're not going to stop fighting in order to live in Valencia or the Geneva convention. I'm guessing that you don't get to see this footage, but just in case, I want you to know

431
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,460
I love you, too.

432
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,380
And I will always love you.

433
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,050
It's like the first day.

434
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,300
at the University.

435
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,630
If decompression is not performed correctly,the

436
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:52,960
the bubbles of nitrogen gas could increase by as much as four times their file size in the blood

437
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,210
leaving the diver, unconscious.

438
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,460
What do we do in this case?

439
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,130
- Doesn't show up? - Let's go into a hyperbaric chamber?

440
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,800
That's just great.

441
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,710
but, let me remind you that at times, the chamber is miles away, you

442
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,710
and then you float away with the body.

443
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,920
So, the first thing you have to do is to draw a scuba diver on the launch pad.

444
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,380
I always have to get the person to get hurt in the back,

445
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,500
leaning against him, against our own.

446
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,960
What are you doing here? What do you hear?

447
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,300
Nothing. I already knew that.

448
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,550
Ce știai?

449
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,300
Trebuie să fii foarte prost să nu realizezi că planeta este pe jumătate devastată.

450
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,460
Televiziunea chinezească nu funcționează, iar televiziunea chinezească funcționează întotdeauna.

451
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,800
Știi ce?

452
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
Am nevoie de un asistent pe navă.

453
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,550
Bine.

454
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,000
Spatele lui va fi bine pe corpul nostru,

455
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,960
astfel încât să putem să-i închidem cutia toracică în brațul nostru

456
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,130
și eliberați astfel căile respiratorii. Foarte important.

457
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,710
Și, în acest fel, atragem scafandru la lansare

458
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,550
înot înapoi, evident.

459
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,170
- Alte întrebări? - Scuzați-mă, domnule Gamboa.

460
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,710
Să presupunem că persoana rănită este o femeie cu sânii mari,

461
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,590
de unde îi ținem cutia toracică? De sus, de jos...?

462
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,300
Nu sunt serios.

463
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,800
Ştii? M-am întrebat acelaşi lucru,

464
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,590
dar manualele de supraviețuire nu acordă atenție siliconului.

465
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,300
Ei bine, atunci hai să continuăm cu lecția.

466
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,210
We can't continue on with the lesson.

467
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,460
Well, there are two types of cardiac arrest.

468
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,750
Well, I'm-I'm sorry, class is over. Thank you.

469
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,550
You can hang out with all of you. Except for you.

470
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,920
You might be interested in doing a little bit of work for me.

471
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,630
What do you think?

472
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,920
What can I say?

473
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,960
Work demnește the man.

474
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,300
I am already worn out through the urine.

475
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,000
- You tie it to the boom, right away. Listen to me.

476
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,460
What the hell are you doing?

477
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,550
The normalization of the things in hell.

478
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,380
And accepting the fact that my mattress is so dry that it looks like a rice field.

479
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,380
Uncle Julian spends his nights, drowned, soaking wet...

480
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,630
Come in.

481
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,050
The captain.

482
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,300
I need to talk to you. I can't see you to your cabin?

483
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,750
All right.

484
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,880
Worth it, baby, why don't you just ask Julian, and in addition to, take it to the bridge. Learn how to tie knots, right? Oh, come on. I'll see you later, babe.

485
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,550
Uncle Julian,

486
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,210
is it okay to wet the bed, but that's only sometimes.

487
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,380
Don't worry about it, the first mate, I'll get you a pot for your room.

488
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,130
Go ahead, Please.

489
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,460
But you don't, you can't use your brains?

490
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,420
Right now, my daughter, he sees the usual wet bed sheets up to 40 years of age.

491
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,050
- It normalizes it for you? The girl left her happy.

492
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,670
Don't worry about it. Easy, we grow it, how it should be.

493
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,170
You're not, you're not her mother. The doctor is her mother?

494
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,500
Ricardo, get wet ...

495
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,800
because this is a night all alone to jerk off to that.

496
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Both of them speak in a low voice, while his daughter is in front of you.

497
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,880
And what's worse, you take off out of respect for the memory of Marisa.

498
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,880
Do you want me to put my hands under your shirt?

499
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,500
We can't keep up the heat together in this way.

500
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,210
Just...

501
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,710
Just like that? No movies, no date,...

502
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,550
You're such a jerk.

503
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,050
We're all frozen to death.

504
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,210
Or are you ashamed? - I don't.

505
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,920
Come on, then. Done.

506
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,710
All right.

507
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,460
Right.

508
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,130
- Twitch. What? How would I be able to shake?

509
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,050
I can handle very well with the cold. I've been through so much the cold.

510
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,210
Maybe you need to give me a hug, and for me to keep up the heat for as long as possible, isn't it?

511
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,800
I'm so sorry.

512
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,250
I'm so sorry.

513
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,800
I'm so sorry.

514
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,250
You may ask yourself, why do I punish you, only you, and those two fools have your

515
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,000
the little priest, and the one with the limp.

516
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,300
I don't know. To be alone with me?

517
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,380
- You're a friend to the archbishop of Boston? - I don't.

518
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,710
For the wolf pack's next the dominant

519
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,880
and, if you're done with it, and the rest disappears.

520
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,210
It's only fair. I've seen it in a documentary. That's right, yeah.

521
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,960
I haven't been able to finish a lesson from your account. Do you want to hear the end of it?

522
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes, please.

523
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,380
The...

524
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:05,170
sleep apnea, or dive in apnea is a suspension of the voluntary into the water.

525
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,630
When it is lacking oxygen, the body responds to the compression of the diaphragm,

526
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,960
since there is an increase in CO2 in the blood.

527
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,500
Which is why a lot of people don't know is that she's left enough of the oxygen in our body.

528
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,920
let's continue with a little bit.

529
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,550
What's the deal? - Can I touch your breast, your Child.

530
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,130
- I'm a girl. You are you.

531
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,210
I'm not. You are you.

532
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,300
I'm just trying to stick my hand in my armpit. - Of course.

533
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,630
It keeps very well with the heat. Don't you know that?

534
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,500
Please correct the course of about 30 degrees, and a body count, because they're on the wrong track.

535
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,630
In addition to that, you're not my type.

536
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,880
I think you're just too cool. - Am I?

537
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,880
No, you're not my kind of thing.

538
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,460
- Don't you? - I don't.

539
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,960
And who do you love?

540
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,960
Someone else on the ship.

541
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,800
The handsome middle of the afternoon.

542
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,050
No way. I don't fuck with me. Why don't you?

543
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,300
After the contraction, there is a feeling of warmth.

544
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,710
I don't pay attention, I can't stand it.

545
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,550
How do you like a guy who is waiting for the squat to put a bath robe?

546
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,050
I've seen it.

547
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,550
I think it's so sexy to me.

548
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,050
In addition, he is a professor of survival.

549
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,630
And I'm not sure if I would have been locked up with him, he would be out a long time ago.

550
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,300
I like to go out with.

551
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,590
Take your clothes off.

552
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,550
What? Take your clothes off. You're not going to stop until I get to see you naked.

553
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,920
- Do you want me to take it? - You're not.

554
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,130
I need to know who you are,

555
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,920
do you know the environment in which you move in.

556
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,920
You're wrong about me, kid.

557
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,460
Because, in the ocean, I'm the big one.

558
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,880
Hey, Hey, Hey Gamboa. What do you do?

559
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,210
Hey! Good, and you?

560
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,460
What's the deal? What's the deal? I've got some company.

561
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,460
What's the matter with you?

562
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,800
You with me? Nothing. You with anything?

563
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,800
I saw you take the antacid at the wrong time in 15 years

564
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,210
and you do it only when you are in trouble.

565
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,960
I'll do it for you. What's the matter with you?

566
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,380
Nothing.

567
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:06,630
At Home. The place to find the course that makes me wake up.

568
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,380
Oh, Doctor? Yes, that's right.

569
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,050
He says, why don't you slip, I'm sleeping in her room.

570
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,960
I was flirting with her.

571
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,880
Do you know what is the matter with you?

572
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,210
He's the jealous type.

573
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,960
- About what? - About what? He's the jealous type.

574
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:29,130
Marisa, this is your wife at home. Julian, it's your wife on the ship.

575
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,710
- And all of a sudden, and harmony. - Together?

576
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
I don't care about the Doctor.

577
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,380
I don't want to start over or something. The end of the story.

578
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,880
Ricardo, in his Captain's telling me all this?

579
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,050
Ricardo.

580
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,630
Well, in the first place.

581
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,380
You know, Marisa was like a sister to me.

582
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,800
And she's not here, you are too.

583
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,210
If you do decide to take it out of the way, I don't think you're cheating on her.

584
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,460
And second of all, Julian is the one, that of a dog abandoned,

585
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,380
and it is up to you.

586
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:06,710
It would take the ship to the reef, just to get your attention.

587
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,800
Just take it. I made it with love, with love.

588
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,210
From what I can tell you about the fish that big?

589
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,550
Well...

590
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,300
I can't tell you because...

591
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,380
Because it will be our little secret.

592
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,800
I understand.

593
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,800
Why do we keep secrets?

594
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,630
For that, there are things that...

595
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,050
Because the rest you don't need to know that...

596
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,130
I can't hurt you. Do you understand? - I do.

597
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,800
Where is the antacid?

598
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,460
The antacid... it's in front of your very eyes.

599
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,050
What's the deal? Hey - hey-hey.

600
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,800
What's the situation.

601
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,710
What is the situation for the rest of the world. Well, I'll leave you two to your business.

602
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,460
CONNECTING A SATELLITE

603
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,550
THE CONNECTION WITH THE SATELLITE HISPASAT 14 VIEWS: THE WESTERN PART OF THE EARTH

604
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,960
START THE DOWNLOAD

605
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,210
You Don Ricardo's...

606
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,300
Just let me know. - No, you go first.

607
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,550
Don't tell me. Why?

608
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,210
It can...

609
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,630
they have become a bit blind to the Doctor. No, not at all. I don't have blind at all.

610
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:18,380
In fact, I've opened up my eyes.

611
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,380
I've done it? Yes.

612
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,460
The first thing I did was to talk to her, and...

613
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,800
I've cleared things up.

614
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,630
Well...

615
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,210
And how did he take it? CONNECTION ERROR

616
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,960
It was a bit of a disappointment.

617
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,550
Well, that's how I was crying like a crazy person.

618
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,960
She'll get over it.

619
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,380
Do you want to go to see it. No I Don't.

620
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,800
I would rather think about other things. - All right.

621
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:21,630
Why don't you go on the fishing trip, like always.

622
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,380
Oh, come on.

623
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,880
- Oh, yeah? - Shall we?

624
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,630
Hey - hey-hey. I don't eat it for dinner? Stop by for dinner, dad.

625
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,380
Gamboa had been trying to drown it in a dish washing machine. I can barely alive.

626
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,210
Do you have a grudge against the teacher, and you want it to be us.

627
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,630
What grudges?

628
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,130
I swear to God

629
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,960
I would keep it out of my head and it won't let me breathe.

630
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,800
That guy was crazy, really. - You are under arrest.

631
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,800
We'll report back about what happened.

632
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,550
We're gonna go to what's right in court, if necessary.

633
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,800
But, if you put your head in a bucket, I swear to god I will kick you out. How do we do that? It's his word against mine.

634
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,960
A word from the teacher, against your asshole with a stick of gum.

635
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:13,300
Do you think I will believe you? - What do you think you're talking to him?

636
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,960
Maybe it was all a misunderstanding. I would hire a teacher so paranoid.

637
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,550
- Get yourself in his dressing room, ask for an explanation. - What is your explanation? Huh?

638
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,050
You need to make your crazy is that crazy to come clean.

639
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,130
What are the chances that you get it right?

640
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,210
The ship is made of wood.

641
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,630
And the regulations provide that there must be a smoke detector in each of the 5 ft.

642
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,380
And there's another one over here.

643
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:51,050
The only chance we have is to make it to the alarm of the bridge,

644
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,960
because there's always someone out there for you, okay?

645
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,630
And if you don't hear it? If this doesn't work?

646
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,550
Well, if you don't hear us, instead of freezing to death,

647
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:08,300
we're going to die of suffocation, because there is no grid air vent.

648
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,710
We can try it.

649
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,380
Oh, come on.

650
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,800
My fingers are frozen.

651
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,460
It's slippery.

652
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,380
I... I ... I can't. I can't.

653
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,130
I can't. - All right.

654
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,800
All right. Calm down. Give me that.

655
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,550
Give me your hands, give it to me.

656
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,210
- The more the better? - Freeze.

657
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,130
I guess I can just feel it.

658
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,460
All right.

659
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,130
We believe that it is impossible to get a fire going in the freezer.

660
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,630
Sometimes things happen to you is impossible.

661
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:29,460
If it doesn't work well, at least we're going to be spending a great night, don't you?

662
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,300
Yes.

663
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,880
But for me, it's so cold.

664
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,380
I'm so cold. - Come here.

665
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,880
I don't see any light. If there is no light, there is no coastline.

666
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,130
Corrected to 15 degrees.

667
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,800
Set your course for the north Star.

668
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,460
Just let them off the canvas. Slow down.

669
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,800
The bridge was burned.

670
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,710
What do you do? - Fine.

671
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,380
It is so swollen and hurt so much.

672
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,380
I'm so glad to hear you say that. If you're in need of something.

673
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,300
Do you know where the Captain is? - I don't.

674
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,800
Julia.

675
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,880
Aren't you going to ask me a question about anything?

676
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,380
Aren't you going to tell me that it's madness to go to the board when you're pregnant?

677
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,710
I'm...

678
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,210
Oh, yeah, I'm not going to tell you something.

679
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,800
I don't know if you know this, how certain are you that you're a mother at your age

680
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,300
but the baby is much more important than you might think.

681
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,380
This baby is the most...

682
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,300
The most important thing in the world.

683
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,130
And I need you to take care of it.

684
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,050
No, no, we're not going to fit in there.

685
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,300
It's not a place.

686
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,380
But-but - what's this guy's got three passports.

687
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,880
Mexico...

688
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,130
In mexico, Cuba and Hungary.

689
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,300
I don't know. Maybe it's the best.

690
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,630
But he does have three different identities.

691
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,050
- There is no signal. - It is not possible, Please.

692
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,800
The satellite is still up there. - It is.

693
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,800
But the antenna all the way down here I'm not there. And what if the dishes are not there

694
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,300
there is no signal. I understand.

695
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,300
And what are the feelers out there, Please?

696
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,300
Do you know why, don't you?

697
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,630
Bubble, hey, look at me.

698
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,050
Don't you tell Her?

699
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,210
I don't.

700
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,880
Because it is not a secret.

701
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,050
I'll answer the door, he said, is that if people know that there are...

702
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,250
in an accident, and that all the land was gone, and that he would hurt her.

703
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:13,300
Do you know what it is, is a particle accelerator?

704
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,800
Are you sad right now?

705
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,800
I don't.

706
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,130
I'm not sad.

707
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,300
I'm happy.

708
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,550
it's you and me, are we alive.

709
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,550
I've always hovered on the ship.

710
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,800
This is our home.

711
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,710
Come along with Her.

712
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,630
What the hell! This guy could be a serial killer, a psychopath, he's a drug dealer,

713
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,880
while the search in his bag.

714
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,550
Good night.

715
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,210
- Come on, come on come on. In the dressing room. But what is it?

716
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,550
'Cause I'm a fool, and thou art a priest.

717
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,380
Can you please tell me what are you doing here?

718
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,880
I've come to the...

719
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,460
... in order to ask for an apology.

720
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,130
Come on in.

721
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,800
- Captain. What happened to you?

722
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,550
It has been a disaster.

723
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,460
Just wait for me here.

724
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,460
I'll be right back.

725
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,960
Where did he sound the alarm? - During the bridge of the engine.

726
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,380
I'm coming!

727
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,710
I don't have my phone. Put it on your own.

728
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,460
Ricardo, are you coming?

729
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,210
I've seen a ton of great.

730
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,710
Is anyone in here? - Dad!

731
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,630
Dad!!! Dad!!!

732
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,050
Don't worry, honey. Just stay calm.

733
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,550
Get out there and put out the fire now.

734
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,460
Carlos, you go get some towels for you.

735
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,960
Dear, dear, are you all right?

736
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,960
Are you all right, darling?

737
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,210
It's over. You're freezing.

738
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,050
It was all my fault. I walked in and I forgot to latch the door.

739
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,800
I Accept all responsibility for taxes, cap.

740
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,130
It's not my fault. - I'm pretty sure that was it.

741
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,800
Honey.

742
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,460
What are you doing here?

743
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,380
Oh,come on,

744
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,550
go to Her, I'll make you a bowl of soup.

745
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,630
Be careful.

746
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:52,380
Don't worry about it, captain. Calm down, there's nothing wrong with it.

747
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,550
In addition to that, the things of your daughter, and I'm still a little bit cold.

748
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,880
Stay away from my daughter.

749
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,550
I've heard over the walkie-talkie. What happened to you?

750
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:22,380
Nothing, just a small fire. It's all worked out. Don't worry about it.

751
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,130
You didn't bring your fishing line?

752
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,460
I don't.

753
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:28,460
Here, Julian.

754
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,210
I'm just delaying the inevitable for months and months, but...

755
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,500
Why?

756
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,380
You were right about that ship, and the family does not go well together.

757
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,210
So...

758
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,960
I have to leave the ship.

759
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,880
The Camera. Come on, turn it on.

760
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,710
I know that we all make mistakes, don't you?

761
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,380
That's why I'm giving you a chance to ask for a formal apology

762
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,630
before the facts are known. Are you threatening me, boy?

763
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,130
What would come to be known, exactly?

764
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,130
I stayed after class to go over the lesson.

765
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:08,960
- Oh, come on. Wait.

766
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,460
Done.

767
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,960
All right.

768
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,300
Or are you looking for a tutor?

769
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:19,380
What would come to be known it's you, you, you slipped into my room.

770
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,960
The memory is full.

771
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,050
I need to get out of things.

772
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,960
You can see the nervous boy.

773
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,800
It is possible that you may need to drink more water. I don't want anything?

774
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,550
Oh, come on.

775
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,960
I don't fuck with me Anymore.

776
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,300
Take a scotch tape, aspirin, go to bed.

777
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,130
And don't be stupid. - No, no, you're a sailor, but I'm a father.

778
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:50,210
Julian and I am a very selfish thing I brought my daughters here.

779
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,630
I want you to wait up so the Ship let's go back to disco

780
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:56,300
and you can see the tooth fairy when she's coming after your teeth, Valerie.

781
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:59,300
Here may be a fairy on the tooth. I went too far.

782
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,960
- You are in there, that's all... no, No, Julian, that's...

783
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,710
In today's crash of a pee-pee yet, but tomorrow will be a period of time,

784
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,960
the next day, the first of a lipstick, and the first love of the Ainhoei.

785
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,960
I don't belong to them, Julian.

786
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:26,300
Will you do me a favor and drive the Polaris 20 years of age?

787
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,380
I don't fuck with me, man.

788
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,460
If I go with you?

789
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,050
You've got your son is here.

790
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:39,880
Oh, yeah, I don't.

791
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,710
You have to delete the photos from my mother?

792
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,050
Give it to me.

793
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,300
Give it to me.

794
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,710
Captain, you might be interested to know that you've got three passports.

795
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:58,960
Do not delete it.

796
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,050
I can see that you don't have to tell all your friends who's the big fish in the ocean.

797
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,050
Oh, man, you are a deranged psychopath

798
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,880
and I would have to turn himself in. I'll report back.

799
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,880
No, no, no I don't report anything on here.

800
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,380
I'm giving you two options.

801
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,340
One, you get down to do it and get out.

802
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:47,210
If you have the courage to stay here, be careful

803
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,380
'cause tonight,

804
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:51,710
tomorrow or any other night

805
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,630
the three idiots are falling in the water geamandă and no one ever finds it.

806
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,050
And the three of them:

807
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,550
You're the one who's gonna get on the boat, and you will be gone.

808
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,050
Once you arrive at the port, your journey is over, the Gamboa.

809
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:18,130
You will report to the right authorities of the port concerned.

810
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,550
Please, I'm waiting for you.

811
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,210
It's very, very important. I need to talk to you.

812
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,710
So, if you don't, he's left this earth, there is no Facebook.

813
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:45,550
If there are no Facebook...

814
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,460
I'm not going to be friends. Do you have any friends that already.

815
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:51,300
We have a captain,

816
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,130
you've got me,

817
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,710
you've got all the new guys.

818
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,960
And I think we're gonna have plenty of time to get to know each other.

819
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,380
But we can't do anything.

820
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,380
We can make a new Facebook.

821
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:11,380
There isn't anything right now, so that we can make it whatever you want.

822
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:12,880
What do you think?

823
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,210
I want to invent the internet.

824
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,960
And Coca-Cola. I want you to make up a Coca-Cola!

825
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:26,880
Captain, you're bleeding.

826
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,380
Yes, it's no problem. Just a place where I scraped it. Listen to me carefully.

827
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,130
- Captain. I'm going to start a life on the land with my children.

828
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,710
- I don't. I don't want to lose what we have.

829
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,130
This is not So...

830
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,880
- Open it Anymore, and I'm... now I'm no longer a captain.

831
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,630
- Ricardo-open. Listen to me.

832
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:46,550
I can hear you, damn it. I have to tell you something very important.

833
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,840
What is the most important thing that you have to say?

834
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,880
You've wet the bed again?

835
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,630
I'm so sorry.

836
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,880
The captain.

837
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:09,800
What I'm trying to say is that the storm could not have been an accident of weather,

838
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,880
it was all a mistake

839
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,380
the consequences of the geological return.

840
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,880
Let's make a list of all the things that you need to come up with.

841
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,550
The continents are in the water.

842
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,050
The zoo with all the animals.

843
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:31,960
There may be islands.

844
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:33,920
The candies.

845
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,380
... atolls, or nothing at all.

846
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,050
This is the west side of the planet right now. The signal was turned off when we are going to look at the other side.

847
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,210
Songs.

848
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,550
The people?

849
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,210
What does this mean?

850
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:10,130
I can't make it up, people.

851
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,130
I don't.

852
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,130
I can't make it up the people, the Land.

853
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,210
It is very likely that...

854
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,550
we're the only people in the world at this point in time.

855
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,300
I can't.

856
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,960
What is this?

857
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,710
What's going on here?

858
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:11,210
I can't take jokes or any of that crap right now.

859
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,630
- Look at it! - It is a kind of high-risk. Things are changing down here.

860
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,460
If it suffers a hemorrhage, a child should be able to die, and so was she.

861
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,050
I like it a lot doesn't show up,

862
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:31,630
so, I don't ask you to miss out on this opportunity.

863
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:34,300
You accept the Captain's daughter, an encounter with the bad guy?

864
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,050
Forget about it!

865
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,130
In the name of God, I beg you to get us out of the woods!

866
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:44,210
Do you have a date with a guy? On board the ship?

867
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,130
Julian's, just leave it at that.

868
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,050
Do you think the story of the black hole? Don't you?

869
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,710
I believe in what I see.
